Nettie Stewart moved with her parents from South Carolina in 1941 to Jamaica, Queens where her father worked as a minister for the African Methodist Episcopal Church.  In 1951, Nettie and her husband moved to FlushingÕs Bland Houses, a public housing development in downtown Flushing on Roosevelt Ave.  Nettie has vivid memories of downtown Flushing from that time.
