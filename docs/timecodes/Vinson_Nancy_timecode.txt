I’ve lived in this neighborhood 30 years. A lot of new businesses have come into the area over that time. It’s always been safe.  I used to come home all hours, and always felt safe.   My parents came from Puerto Rico and worked in factories.  I was born in Manhattan.  I used to work at Sachs Fifth Avenue.  I come here with people from the neighborhood.  I go to the church near here.    My kids I had in the Bronx many moons ago.  I came here when my kids left home, and I wanted to get away from an area that wasn’t safe to be. I told my mother I just can’t stay here.  And so I came over here.  Somebody told me about Astoria, and there was an empty apartment, so I thought I’ll take it (on 29th Street).  I’m still there.    Sure I’m going to stay here – as long as I can climb up five flights then I see what happens.    At Sachs I was a sales lady in shoes. You meet a lot of nice people; you meet a lot of celebrities.  Well one time I saw Jackie Gleeson.  But most times the celebrities used to have personal shoppers.  They would go into a special room and try them on, and then ship them to a hotel room or whatever.    After so many years working it’s good to be retired.  I go to some of the senior centers where they have music and dancing or play bingo, and I volunteer by helping collect the money.
