Bridget was born in Doon, East Limerick, Ireland.  Her father was a foreman for road work crews.  Her mother was very intelligent, although she didnÕt have access to formal education.  Bridget received primary education in Ireland, but she was not able to afford secondary education and worked as a nanny.  In 1957, she immigrated to America, following her sister to the Bronx, where she worked as a telephone operator.  She met her husband, originally a neighbor in Ireland, in Gaelic Park.
