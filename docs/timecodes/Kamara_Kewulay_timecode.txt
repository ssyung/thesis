In this interview, Kewulay discusses how he came to America and how his experience in New York has taught him the value of diversity and language. Kewulay has lived in Jackson Heights since 1991, he discusses the changes that have occurred in his neighborhood and how it reflects on immigrants and other races.   00:00:40 Kewulay first came to United States in 1971 when he was 17 years old because his friend asked him if he wanted to finish one more year in high school in America.  00:01:35 His friend asked Kewulay to stay with a family named the Jackson family in Southwest Massachusetts. There were 5 boys in total, including himself.  00:02:40 Kewulay gotten accepted into many colleges but he decided to go to Oneonta, which is in upstate New York. 00:03:05 Kewulay was an active student in College, so he finished very early than other people. Then he got his first job in New York City. 00:04:37 Kewulay decided that he wanted to go to a new school so that he could do social research and learn more about political economy.  00:05:20 Kewulay lived an apartment in Corona and he stayed there until 1978 when he left and try to find a bigger place to live. 00:05:35 the reason why he wanted to move to bigger place was because of his pregnant wife. They moved somewhere in Jackson Heights one month before his son was born in 1991. 00:06:53 Kewulay never intended to become an immigrant when he came to the states. He came as a student. 00:10:32 Kewulay came to United States, not to just to make a big dream, he wanted the education and learn new things.  00:11:00 When Kewulay came to America, Africa gotten worse over the years.  00:11:30 Kewulay knew how to speak English when he came to America, so it wasn’t a problem. But he spoke in West African English accent, which made it difficult for people to understand.  00:12:39 Language is more about culture than about anything else. Even though you spoke other languages than English, there is still a language barrier. Kewulay gives an example of the ‘language and cultural barrier’.  00:18:20 Kewulay believes that in America, skin color gives too much history and little identity to your status in society, which cause racialization.  00:22:48 Kewulay believes that New York has the best transportation system that he knows since he has been traveling quite often. New York is an ideal place for living since you can just get around other places without a car and taxi. 00:24:55 Kewulay likes New York because he likes to learn and be educated about anything. He believes that in New York, people are able to learn about anything.  00:26:00 Kewulay also knows that New York has a lot of bad experiences and things that were very unpleasant for certain people, however, it is still history for him to remember.  00:28:00 Kewulay noticed that in his neighborhood, there were a lot more Mexicans than Columbian people now. There are other changes in various races too when it comes to population diversity.  00:32:20 Kewulay also noticed that in his neighborhood, there has been things that have been gentrified to the point where you never see those things again. 00:34:30 Kewulay believes that he is a scholar and that he was fine living with more Mexican people in his neighborhood. He knows that even though that they don’t know him as well, he knows their history and their life; they are like family to him. 00:39:50 Kewulay never seen any crimes in Jackson Heights ever, but he knows that there are crimes in his area and other neighborhood as well. He believes that crimes has always been there for a long time before, but he also believes that it still exist because security/police system has never changed.  00:41:10 Kewulay taught policing in John Jay College before for 22 years, but personally, he doesn’t like to deal with policing because it is racialized. The police treat other races differently depending on what skin color or race you are.  00:45:00  Kewulay believes that the prices are being overpriced for                         people who can’t afford it. He worries for the immigrants who come here  because he is worried about where they are going to live.
