Kaleena was born in 1960s and migrated from Hong Kong with her family in 1984. She and her family lived in Woodside, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Briarwood, and Rego Park. She attended William Cullen Bryant High School, Polytechnic Institute, and Hunter College. Her family chose to live in Queens so that they can be closer to their relatives, who at the time also lived in Queens. While her family and she moved from one neighborhood to another for a bigger living quarter, she noticed the difference between the neighborhoods they lived in, as well as the increasing Chinese immigrant population in Queens. 00:01:00 Kaleena and her six family members lived in a studio in Woodside, including her parents, and four siblings. She attended William Cullen Bryant High School in Long Island City. 00:02:03 She talks about getting used to life in New York, such as language barrier in school but slowly adjust to her new life. 00:03:01 Kaleena talks about her school life at William Cullen Bryant High School as an ESL student and a new immigrant. No Chinese teachers at the school at the time. Classmates were different for every class.  00:04:20 Neighborhood in Woodside, living near Woodside and rent was around $500 for a studio. Parents worked at a sweatshop in Chinatown. 00:05:34 Kaleena’s mother brought grocery in Chinatown at the end of the day after work. 00:05:48 The family moved into Elmhurst for a bigger apartment with one bedroom after six years in 1990. 00:06:24 Kaleena describes the neighborhood in Elmhurst. There are more people in Elmhurst compare to Woodside because there are more shops around. The apartment they rent was located between Roosevelt Avenue and 82nd street. It was near the 7 train. 00:07:00 Queens as first destination and choice of settlement because relatives also live in Queens. 00:07:13 After living in Elmhurst for two years, Kaleena’s older brother brought a one family residential house with three bedrooms in Jackson Heights and the family moved in. The house costed between $100,000 to $200,000 in the 90s.  00:08:11 Kaleena’s older brother got married. Her siblings and she bought a two bedrooms apartment in Briarwood and moved. They lived in Briarwood for twelve years. Transportation was more convenient and her relatives were living nearby. 00:09:21* Kaleena and her family started going to Chinatown less, and went to Flushing more instead. Flushing was empty and not many Chinese was in the area in the 1980s, but the area started blooming in the 2000s as more Chinese are moving into the neighborhood and small Chinese-owned business started booming. It was more convenient to go to Flushing than Chinatown.  00:11:01 She moved to Rego Park in 2012. There is a Chinese supermarket in the neighborhood within five minute walking distance. 00:12:20*  Kaleena’s childhood memories in Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Because her aunt lived in Corona, she often went to the park with her siblings and cousins to play handball and to ride bikes. In the recent years, she noticed there are a lot of Hispanics in the park during the summer and they are usually playing football or using the grills for BBQ. It is also difficult to find parking in the park. 00:14:30 Kaleena often passed by the places she and her family used to live because her aunts are still living in the neighborhoods. 00:16:49  Kaleena and her family lived in Kowloon, Hong Kong before migrating to New York. Similar to the apartment they lived in Woodside, her family of seven including her older brother were living together in a studio when they were in Hong Kong. Her brother migrated to New York later because he was over the age of 18 and couldn’t come at the same time as the family. 00:17:39* Kaleena’s first impression of America. She thought there would be more non-Chinese living in America so it might be easier to learn English, but she realized there were Chinese in her high school and college and she's more used to communicating with Chinese. 00:18:44* Things her family brought with them when they were migrating. Her family tried to bring as much as they could to America. Because they knew they were starting a new life and don’t know what to expect in a new country, they brought a lot of clothes and other things with them to America. Even though there were things left behind, her older brother who was the last to migrate took care of the rest. 00:19:39 Parents found work in sweatshop from newspaper. Kaleena and her siblings also worked at the sweatshop with her parents during the summer.
