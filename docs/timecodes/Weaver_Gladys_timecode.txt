Gladys Weaver was born in Saluda, South Carolina.  When she was still very young, her parents decided to relocate the family to New York City.  They first lived in Manhattan but did not enjoy the crowded apartment living conditions.  The family soon moved to Jamaica, Queens, where they were able to live in a house with a backyard and driveway.  Gladys thoroughly enjoyed her early life in Jamaica.  Neighbors were all well acquainted and treated each other like family.  She attended P.S 40 elementary school, Jamaica Vocational High School and also took a course in Business Administration at Royal Business School in Manhattan.  She married her husband in 1947 and despite learning from the doctors that she could not conceive, gave birth to a son in 1951.  Religion has always been a core component of GladysÕs life.  She took a General Bible course at Tabernacle Bible Institute and also earned a masterÕs degree in theology & religious education at United Christian College.  In the course of her religious education, she has been licensed as a missionary, ordained as a minister and has also been a church elder.  As Gladys lived through these experiences, Jamaica progressively changed.  The neighborhoodÕs transformation began during the 1950s when the government actively encouraged whites to move out and settled blacks into the neighborhood.  Today, Gladys laments that much of JamaicaÕs cohesion and community-feel have now eroded.  Present day Jamaica is drastically different from the predominantly Italian American community of the 1940s. This interview has two breaks in which the interviewers turned off the recorder to take a break.  The first is at 00:13:53 and the second break is at 00:22:32.  00:01:09  Parents chose to live in Jamaica, Queens.  Parents moved out in Queens when she was very young (moved to Queens in 1937 from Manhattan; lived on 108th Ave, between 170 and 171st streets).  She has never moved from Jamaica since. 00:02:25  Parents originally came from South Carolina.  Moved to Manhattan but were unused to living in crowded conditions.  (Did not like living in an apartment). Parents wanted to live in a private, detached house with a backyard and driveway.  They moved to Queens.   00:03:49  Parents moved to 104th Road, where they purchased a home.  Gladys got married in 1947 and moved from her parentsÕ house to a co-op at 109th Ave. (exact address: 109-34 172nd St. Jamaica, NY 11433).  She has been living in the co-op since 1952.   00:04:30  Enjoyed living in the co-op because it was quiet.  She remembers that everyone in Jamaica knew each other and treated each other like family. 00:05:04  Families in Jamaica would always provide shelter/take in wanderers.  The neighborhood was very safe; gun violence was unheard of. 00:06:16  Attended a Baptist church on South Road and Railroad Ave. A housing project was built over Railroad Ave. 00:07:05  Jamaica used to be home to Italian, Jewish and Polish Americans.  There were a lot of storefronts and also some bars, which were called Òbeer gardens.Ó 00:07:58  Worked in Long Island City at Silver Cup Bakery. Shift was from 4-12.  People did not have to be too vigilant against potential criminals.  She does not understand how the neighborhood has changed so rapidly. 00:09:30  There were bakeries, dressmakers, lawyerÕs offices, tailors and beautiful storefronts on the streets.   00:10:25  Remembers mom and pop stores on New York Blvd.  Also remembers Jewish stores.  Storeowners knew every child in the neighborhood.  She misses the family like cohesion amongst Jamaica residents during the 1940s.   00:11:08  Parents probably moved to Jamaica because the lifestyle of the neighborhood was similar to that of their original home in South Carolina. 00:11:47  There was always a truck with fresh produce that came 2-3 times a week.  People bought fish from a fish man and baked goods from a bread man.  The milk man delivered milk on peopleÕs front stoop. 00:13:18  She misses how life was like in the past. 00:14:39  The neighborhood began to change after the Second World War and then began to change drastically during 1949-1950.  At the end of World War 2, government built public housing projects in Jamaica.  00:15:40  People who originally lived in the Bronx or Harlem were relocated to the public housing projects in Jamaica.   00:16:08  Schools were mostly Italian with some Jews.  There were very few Chinese; they worked mostly as launderers.   00:16:52  There used to be an Italian Feast celebration every year in Jamaica (a testament to the highly established Italian community in the neighborhood).   00:17:25  Played and socialized with Italians. 00:17:43  City bought up homes belonging to Italians.  Government agents would stick notices on peopleÕs door, forewarning people that the neighborhood demographic is becoming increasingly black.  The government offered to buy houses from the Italians.  The Italians and other whites were basically convinced to move out of the neighborhood. 00:19:09  Many black people came to Jamaica to buy their first houses.  However, they could not keep up with the costs and often faced foreclosure.  Black people also did not realize that the house they bought was often not worth the cost (they were overcharged). 00:21:50  Sent her son to the same elementary school (P.S. 116) as her sister and youngest brother.  She was shocked at how drastically the school (demographic) had changed.  00:22:54  Got married in her parentsÕ home at 164-12 104th Road in Jamaica, NY.  Met her husband on Easter Sunday coming home from church.  He did not make a good first impression on her. She lied and told him she was married because she was on her way to a dance in Manhattan with her cousin and didnÕt want him to join them.  00:24:15  As time went by, she began to notice her future husbandÕs good qualities.  She admired his church values, family values and moral values.   00:24:50  Doctors told her that she would never have a child. 00:26:02  Prayed for a child.  She became pregnant within 3 months.   00:26:55  She was married in her home (a house ceremony).  A limousine took them (she and her husband) to a ceremony at EddieÕs Palm Garden on Merrick Road      00:27:50  Husband has passed away and son moved to Maryland. 00:29:31 Before her husband met her, he served in Armed forces.  He was wounded badly in combat.  Since he was a veteran, they were easily able to obtain an apartment.  He was able to choose a residence from the apartment blueprint. 00:31:00  Only married families could live in the apartments. 00:31:27  Husband was originally from Johnston, South Carolina.  He came from Johnston to live with her cousins.  She became acquainted with him through her family. 00:32:13  Memories of childhood in South Carolina are not very clear.  She remembers attending a school in her natal city of Saluda.  Following her sonÕs birth, she toured South Carolina and became more familiar with the state.   00:32:39  The teachers in South Carolina liked/favored her sister.  She basically remembers going to church and school. 00:33:02 Hated New York.  She went on an elevator for the first time in New York.  She did not enjoy living in a crowded apartment. 00:35:25  When her family moved to Jamaica, the neighborhood was still not serviced by the subway.  People had to take the Q60 bus from Forest Hills 71st Continental station.  Then, to get to Jamaica Ave, people had to take a trolley.  There was no F line, only the E line.   00:36:22  Eventually they extended the subway to Jamaica.  People paid a nickel for the bus and a nickel for the subway; it cost a dime to commute to Manhattan.      00:37:30  Her first saving account was at the post office (postal savings account).  Post office gave her a deposit book.  Every time she made a deposit, she would receive a certification stamp on her deposit book. 00:40:40  There were open fields everywhere and a lot of space for kids to run.   00:41:22  Bus terminal used to be on New York Boulevard, before it was relocated to its current location in Jamaica.
