Aaron Gorman grew up in Richmond Hill, Queens.  He has fond  memories of playing baseball on a sandlot team with Phil Rizzuto who went on to play with the Yankees (1941-1956) and was later elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. During World War II, Mr. Gorman worked (unknowingly) on the Manhattan Project and only found out after the bombings in Japan that he had helped to end the war just in time to prevent his younger brother from a tour of duty in the Pacific. After meeting his Brooklyn-born wife at a resort in the Catskills, the two married and moved to Flushing. Mr. Gorman’s current home was their second home where they lived since the 1960’s. Mr. Gorman relates how the neighborhood has fewer Jewish residents than it did when they first arrived and speaks about his family’s interactions with local temples and the social activities they provide for him currently.  00:00:00 Phil Rizzuto 00:03:20 Moving to the neighborhood, home’s previous owners 00:04:59 Fresh Meadows’ place in Flushing 00:09:52 What neighborhood was like when they moved in, value of house 00:13:02 Neighbors mostly Jewish *00:13:40 Mafia neighbor with basement phone 00:16:38 Relationships with neighbors 00:20:10 Transportation – having two cars 00:23:00 Health care for him and his sick wife 00:27:50 Driving habits now 00:29:00  Change in the neighborhood, Asian neighbors *00:31:00 Interaction with local temple, changes over the years 00:35:05 Changes with age, not moving, but having an aid 00:36:08 Different religions in the neighborhood 00:38:58 Used to all be Jewish in Flushing 00:39:34 His Jewish traditions/observances *00:40:41 Meeting his wife at Grossinger’s Resort in the Catskills  00:43:54 Wife from Brooklyn, he from Richmond Hill, first lived in Kew Gardens, then Flushing on Kissena, then Fresh Meadows *00:45:13 Growing up in Richmond Hill, baseball, Phil Rizzuto *00:49:59 Working on the Manhattan Project, not allowed to fight in WWII 00:55:00 Became one of first employees of Atomic Energy after the war until 1959 00:56:00 Took job in Long Island to not travel so much *00:58:58 Everyone happy about the role of the A-bomb in the war 01:03:00 His brother’s near death story from WWII 01:04:35 Civilian involvement with war effort 01:09:04 His Russian parents, understanding/speaking Yiddish 01:11:54 Switching from Orthodox to Conservative temple for daughters 01:14:03 No carry-over of Russian traditions 01:16:23 His private accounting practice over the years 01:24:00 Medical problems *01:27:15 He comments on the photos his daughter sent before interview 01:33:40 Close relationship with his wife, her death 01:39:15 Relationship with daughter Robin, her book, her marriage 01:41:00 How Flushing has changed, shopping, banks changing 01:42:10 Daughters’ public schools and colleges 01:43:30 Movie theaters in neighborhood 01:44:04 When he would go to Manhattan, Radio City Music Hall, shopping 01:45:28 Queens vs. Brooklyn accent 01:48:20 Seeing the METS play on senior days 01:54:00 Locking the doors, getting robbed during time his wife was dying 02:03:45 Dancing with his wife in the basement 02:04:39 Dancing and bridge at senior center, making lady friends 02:06:03 Beginning of his decline in health 02:12:50 Shows Natalie and Tom (photographer) a photo of he and his wife in a little plastic viewer, then walks them through the house showing them photos, including wedding photo 02:17:32 Going to see Yankees over the years 02:22:03 Seeing Phil Rizzuto on the day he was released
