Merrill is a care-free, open, and a joyful person. Living life and enjoying what you want to enjoy is what Merrill thrives for. She simply didn’t care for things that don’t interest her. Even though Merrill wishes she could change a few things in her life if she had the chance to, she’s still content with her life. Merrill’s journey in Queens wasn’t exactly smooth, but she fought through it.  00:00:40  Merrill went to the [Long Island University] in Brooklyn. The university used to be the old Brooklyn Paramount Movie Theater.

That’s how her parents met and later got married.  00:03:48     She lived in Queens for all her life. Merrill’s parents had an apartment at [Forest Hills] when she was born. As she grew older, the Lindenbaums bought a house in [Flushing].  00:04:35     In 1950’s, Merrill recalls having her 7th birthday party at her new Flushing residence.  00:05:16     She recalls her parent buying the house in Flushing around 1958 for $30,000.  0005:26     Merrill describes the time of Vietnam War.

She specified that at one point she was almost homeless, but she doesn’t have to worry about that anymore.  00:16:15     Merrill illustrates her childhood and her parents. Generosity was a big part of Merrill’s family.  00:17:12     She recalls a humorous event her father was given a chance to invest in Birdseye frozen food patents. Merrill’s father said, “Who’s gonna eat this frozen food?” and threw away the multi-millionaire opportunity.   00:23:10     Merrill says that she doesn’t talk to her relatives anymore. She’s content with it. In addition, she also describes her childhood best friend, Theresa. 00:29:10     Merrill never had a love in her life. She expresses that, “It just didn’t happen.” She seems comfortable with the idea of not finding love.  00:31:20     Merrill describes her history of residency in Queens. She doesn’t quite recall the days past her residency at Hollis Hills. Back when she lived in Hollis Hills, the neighborhood was not yet officially designated. She would put “Queens Village” as her zip code for mail, in order to get her mail quicker.  00:33:00*    Merrill indicates that she went to public schools for all her life. First she went to [P.S. 188], and then she went to [Junior High 109], which was called [Queens Village Junior High] at the time she attended. She also attended [Martin Van Buren High School]. She recalls the zoning-laws which forced students to go to a certain school that they didn’t want to.  00:38:15     Merrill doesn’t feel lonely because she keeps herself occupied.  She actively looks for new things to do. She does what interests her, if it doesn’t interest her, she will not do it.  00:46:27     Merrill details the comfortable environment she grew up in.

However, when Merrill was growing up everyone around her neighborhood were White-Americans. Also, she stated that there were very few religions around her area.  00:58:00  Merrill boldly states that she’s not xenophobic.   1:00:00     Merrill defines her current neighborhood, [St. Albans]. When Merrill first moved to St. Albans, she wasn’t used to being around so many African Americans and African immigrants.

However, after knowing that she had no interest in those majors, she decided to major in history. She was very interested in history.  1:35:35     Merrill knew what she didn’t want to do, rather than knowing what to do exactly. She likes to do things at her own pace.  1:38:42*     When Merrill looks at her past, she wishes she took more opportunities. In addition, she wishes she had studied harder and gotten better grades. But, she accepts the fact that she can’t go back and change things. Merrill is not sure if she’ll ever find herself, even though she’s happy and content. She never tried to find herself, but rather she went with the flow of life. She expresses about her parents’ sicknesses and noted how they passed away. Merrill mentioned that before her parents passed away, they weren’t “living,” but rather “existing.” Merrill confidently states that she’s definitely “living,” even though her life is not perfect.  1:45:40     Merrill wanted to marry and have kids, but that never happened.
