After recording a reading of his poem, "in memory of mary sendek," poet and Elmhurst resident, Matthew Kremer, answered a few questions about his inspiration to write about Queens and his experiences sharing his work with local residents. Kremer refers to Anthropologist Roger Sanjek's "The Future of Us All: Race and Neighborhood Politics in New York City," and the work of historian, Vincent F. Seyfried as helpful resources for learning about the history of Elmhurst. 00:00:04 Matthewﾃ不 inspiration for this project came from recognizing that his residency in New York City would be short lived because heﾃ不 not fond of living around millions of people for his whole life. 00:00:25 He writes poems about his visions of Elmhurst to reconstruct what it looked like prior to his being there and speak against its gentrification.    00:01:14 He wanted to give something back to the neighborhood so he wouldnﾃ付 be another statistic contributing to the rise of corporatization.  00:02:18 Matthew read a study of the Corona and Elmhurst neighborhoods that gave him a desire to be more accurate in his poems. For instance, he was corrected by a reader when he wrote about the Elmhurst gas tanks imploding. 00:03:59 His poems have been published on a few blogs that speak to Queens related issues. Matthew notes that poetry is always circulated into the same hands, so he wanted them to be accessed by people who know the neighborhood that wouldnﾃ付 normally read poetry. 00:05:22 He feels a sense of awe at the idea that there was once an amusement park called Fairy Land at the site of Queens Center Mall.
