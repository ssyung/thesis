Went into business for him-self in 2000, but remained a consultant to the club. 00:06:00 Change in grounds (fewer grass courts) over the years. Tennis became more popular, tournaments became higher stakes.  What had always been the National Championships at the club became the US Open, which allowed competition to get more serious – more money at stake.  00:09:15 Drawbacks of grass courts 00:09:50 Concerts: procedure for protecting the lawn when setting up for a concert. Audience throwing jelly beans at The Beatles, quite a mess afterward. 00:11:40 Stadium could seat about 14,000 people.

Barry Manilow got angry with Jim’s Polish worker who accidentally ended up in Manilow’s runway from his dressing room to the stage. 00:21:30 Crowds got rowdier in the “rock years,” (late 60’s, early 70’s).

Security was not as tight, “it was an easier time.” Access to stars was very easy. 00:26:15 Significance of concerts starting again is that the stadium is getting use again. Same age as the original Yankee Stadium.

Japanese film crew interviewed him months ahead of time about the club’s preparations for the concert. A promoter for one of these “ethnic” concerts asked for screening around the outside of the venue to prevent onlookers from trampling each other.
