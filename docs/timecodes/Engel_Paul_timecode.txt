Paul Engel’s interview is part of Queens Borough President Helen Marshall’s Queens General Assembly documentation project.  Mr. Engel and fellow Queens General Assembly member, Richard Khuzami met with the Borough President’s Special Assistant on Immigrant & Inter-cultural Affairs, Susie Tanenbaum, to record oral history interviews about their personal histories and their experiences on the Queens General Assembly.  Engel shares some background on his parents’ careers and his educational history.  He also discusses his involvement as a young man with the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon and how that impacted his later professional involvement with cult deprogramming work. Some of Paul Engel's first exposure to multicultural work leading up to his appointment to the Queens General Assembly, was through a project he led on behalf of the Flushing Jewish Community Council that provided services to people from many cultures as a requirement of a grant they got.  His continued work with clergy from many different faiths led to an event that helped to counter the backlash against Muslims and Sikhs in the aftermath of 9/11 in 2001. A highlight of Engel’s recollections of the Queens General Assembly is from the Festivals of Light celebration on January 20, 2004. Engel describes his part in the program, lighting menorah candles as Rabbi Avraham Schechter spoke about traditions surrounding Chanukah. Engel's spontaneous gesture of assistance during the subsequent presentation by Andrew Jackson, resulted in a powerful moment symbolizing the unity of the Queens General Assembly.  00:03:51 Mother worked on Sid Caesar shows, Your Show of Shows included.
