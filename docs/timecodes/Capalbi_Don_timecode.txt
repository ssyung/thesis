Don Capalbi, an Italian-American, is a longtime resident of Flushing, Queens.  As the only child of an Italian immigrant mother and a father born in Peru, Indiana, Capalbi grew up in Astoria and was raised mainly by his mother. This interview concerns CapalbiÕs early life, career, and his interests in religion, philosophy, politics, restaurants, travel, and society. Capalbi heads the Queensboro Hill Civic Association and has served as a community liaison for Assemblywoman Grace Meng.    00:00:12 Capalbi is a longtime Flushing resident 00:00:43 Although couldnÕt recall when mother came to America, she was from Sicily, and Òher father originally migrated to New York and got a job with McClellan,Ó which he described as a competitor of the Woolworth chain. 00:01:11 There were a number of 5 and 10-type chains when he was a boy. 00:01:28 CapalbiÕs grandfather became head carpenter for the chain, which opened around the country: he traveled by railroad.  Stores built their own fixtures, as well as tables for merchandise. 00:01:56 Don lived and grew up in an apartment; china cabinet was created by his grandfather from a piece of store furniture. 00:02:30   Mother was born in 1912 in Sicily (about 100 years old at the time of the interview). 00:02:36 Don is an only child and lived alone with his mother. Father died when Capalbi was 9 years of age.  00:02:58* In regards to mother, he stated that ÒHer father was the first to come here and then, one at a time, the rest of the family came over, with the exception of one sister, the younger sister, fell in love with a boy in Sicily and stayed there.Ó 00:03:11 His father met his mother in Astoria, although the exact circumstances were unknown to him. They lived nearby in Astoria.  00:03:22 DonÕs father was from Indiana, where there is an Italian enclave.  00:03:30 Father was born in Peru (Indiana), and was infant when one of his parents grew sick, and the family went back to Italy. Within a few years, both parents had died of unknown illness. 00:03:54 CapalbiÕs father and siblings were raised by grandmother and worked the farms in Italy. 00:04:10 During late adolescence, the kids developed resources and returned to the United States and settled in New York. 00:04:24 In his twenties, Don was in a bar and turned in his credit card to pay his bar tab, in which the bartender gave it to the waitress, who asked him his name. After hearing his name, she identified herself as a Capalbi from Indiana: her familyÕs name, however, had a ÒyÓ at the end. 00:05:42 This interview may prompt him to ask his mother more questions about his family. Recently had a family reunion, when his mother turned 100, and members of the family (his motherÕs side) came from other parts of the country. 00:06:26* Life in Astoria: Mother spoke of how there was Òa lot of farmland sold in Queens.Ó  She married fairly late, had Don at age 33. 00:07:05 Once, his mother explained how his father was divorced when she met him. 00:07:26 Capalbi visited the graves of his father and his motherÕs mother (died in her early fifties): father died of occupational illness/cancer. 00:07:55* First time Don got married at age 20, but divorced at 23; he believed there was more of a ÒstigmaÓ to being divorced at that time. 00:08:24 Italian community in Astoria: Astoria was comprised of people of Italian and Irish descent, with a synagogue across the street not far from where he lived. 00:08:43 As he was growing up (prepubescent and into puberty), he did not know any kids who were neither Irish or Italian, except for a Polish kid moving into the neighborhood. The Irish were the dominant group since they arrived earlier. 00:09:30* Inclination to not being prejudiced to Asians in Flushing is due to his recollection of what it was like being called a ÒguineaÓ as a kid. 00:10:06 DidnÕt care about race differences between peoples or different races of people. 00:10:18* Transferred from Manhattan College to a number of Catholic schools, then to Long Island University (Brooklyn), which was predominantly Jewish. 00:10:35 Met a fellow who was a black sophomore: they shared many conversations regarding being African-American. Capalbi had been unaware of racial inequalities until then. 00:11:28* Capalbi was born in 1945: was in college when Kennedy was killed. Remembers he was having lunch across the street from campus when he heard about JFKÕs assassination. 00:12:08 Grew up in 50s/60s, and was friends with those of Irish and Italian descent. The Catholic church/parish was fairly important then, maybe less important to the Italians than to the Irish. Church in New York was the church of the Irish Ð style of religion, cathedral named for Irish saint (St. Patrick). 00:12:59* In Italy, the priest did not tell you to read the Bible or encourage it, but to let them teach you Òtheir version of the Bible.Ó 00:13:25 Went to public school for four years and then local parish built a new, large building which was added to their existing elementary school and afforded his mother an opportunity to send Don to Catholic school. 00:13:47 He switched to Catholic school in 5th grade and graduated 8th grade; students were encouraged to go to Catholic high school. 00:14:20 His family was unsophisticated. Women werenÕt as upfront in Òknowing thingsÓ Ð mother had only 4th grade education. Don accepted into many schools, including Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, but chose LaSalle Academy, a small Catholic high school at the corner of 2schools, including Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, but chose LaSalle Academy, a small Catholic high school at the corner of 2schools, including Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, but chose LaSalle Academy, a small Catholic high school at the corner of 2schools, including Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, but chose LaSalle Academy, a small Catholic high school at the corner of 2schools, including Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, but chose LaSalle Academy, a small Catholic high school at the corner of 200:14:57 Boys were encouraged in high school to become priests or brothers. 00:15:16 Christian Brothers taught at LaSalle, and also ran Manhattan College in the Bronx. 00:15:36* Capalbi took religion very seriously at first and felt that if what he was taught about God and the church was true, that the right vocation would be the priesthood/brotherhood.     00:16:21 Took Mandatory Theology 1 & 2 in first year of college, which taught how reasonable it is that there is a God based on reason without teaching. The more he looked at it, the less sense it made to him. 00:17:55 He believes now in a brother/sisterhood of humanity: ÒWeÕre all clones except for our genes and our personal experiences.Ó But if you take out the variability of our genealogy and personal experiences, we become a part of each other, we share the same soul.  00:19:18 Recent experiences reminded him of 1960s hippie culture: Currently Òa plague of hipnessÓ in Williamsburg, like a religion. Also, outside a bar on Lower East Side, he saw three youngsters (in their 20s) sitting on a sidewalk panhandling. In the 60s, mostly affluent youth were in hippie movement, Òtaking a few years out of their life to see what it was like to be poor.Ó 00:21:20 Regrets that he was na•ve towards and not involved in Civil Rights Movement.  He heard Martin Luther King on TV/radio and believed that style of Black oratory was just entertainment. 00:22:43 How Black churches look upon life and death is more real than celebrating death: he admires their attitude. 00:23:26 DonÕs childhood address in Astoria was 26-49 30th Street, a very Ònon-descript working class block with an amalgam of architecture,Ó between Astoria Blvd. and Newtown Ave., near 30th Ave. (which used to be called Grand Ave.).  A lot of youth move into this area now. 00:24:08 Lived in a six-family apartment house, two apartments on each floor. One Irish family lived across the hall from the Capalbi's; generous people who helped Don when his father died. 00:24:36 This family had a summer house in Mastic, Long Island: they would go on weekends in the spring, summer and fall, taking Don and his mother with them. Family patriarch extended the house and took Don with him to help on project. 00:25:22 Local Democratic Club would send kids to Yankee Stadium in summer Ð pre-renovated stadium. Don has recollections of his father: walking down the street with him, holding hands and listening to Yankee games on a transistor radio. Current Citi Field (MetsÕ stadium) reminiscent of Brooklyn DodgersÕ Ebbets Field. 00:27:18   Democratic Party: ÒI have always been interested in policy.Ó As a kid, interested in the Adlai Stevenson campaign. Mother was Òa product of the Depression. And people who lived in the Depression stayed people of the Depression.Ó Even though the Depression ended, the people didnÕt change and did without. His mother was an ÒFDR Democrat.Ó 00:28:05 StevensonÕs first run for president occurred when Don was a child. Don volunteered and helped Stevenson as much as he could as a teenager. 00:28:39 Democratic Club dominated the political landscape of the community; local club important. He was too young to join party or participate in committees. 00:29:58 CapalbiÕs civic engagement came largely due to his philosophical beliefs. He has a very deep philosophy of the meaning of life: ÒI believe the difficulty in finding the answer to what is the meaning of life is because of the fact that life has no meaning. There is no meaning to life. We live like the ants live. There is no meaning unless we put meaning into our lives.Ó 00:30:36 Capalbi has no kids and is married to his second wife. Searches the solar system for any meaning to his life. Tries to create meaning by doing good. 00:31:52 Involved in many volunteer groups, and his travel agency focuses on people with disabilities. Started to focus locally: got involved with neighbor who was running for State Assembly. 00:32:20 To Capalbi, television is like a babysitter for adults of our culture. He prefers reading about and participating in real-life drama of politics. 00:34:01 Listens to news radio Ð refers to particular commentatorÕs style, which is awkward and used to gain attention. Feels most news is presented as Òinfotainment.Ó Prefers Al Jazeera and BBC; Russian news and Chinese news to hear Òother sideÓ of the story. 00:35:39 Radio commentator stated we are living in an oligarchy, not a democracy, because who runs for office is largely determined by a small group. Very difficult for independents to win Ð Capalbi feels this is true at all levels. 00:37:28* He remains involved with politics. Everything, not just politics, is corrupt Ð educational system, Wall Street, etc. Ð because humanity is corrupt. You must deal with and work within the rules. 00:37:57* Works for an Assemblywoman named Grace Meng because she is the best and he receives satisfaction from her, although the pay is low. He believes she is what the country needs. 00:39:35* Acquired his job from neighbor who ran for Assembly and asked Don if he wanted to run for District Leader. District Leader is lowest level of elected office and a non-paying job. 00:40:43 Capalbi became member of one of the Democratic Clubs in Flushing and became vice president of that club. When incumbent assemblywoman ran for re-election, he felt he could not support her for re-election compared to Meng. 00:41:32 Resigned from the Democratic Club under the belief that it wasnÕt proper to remain in the club and not support their candidate. He describes the intrigue involved in running for office, even at the local level. 00:44:27 When Meng was elected, she asked Capalbi to be her Community Liaison. Job included attending events where either Grace couldnÕt make it or felt not important enough for her to go; she sent Capalbi instead.   00:44:50 Most politicians have Community Liaisons under different titles/names; usually a 22-23 yr. old who just sits and takes notes. He tried to do more with it; met many people. 00:45:55 Capalbi questioned why his local civic association seemed to be dormant. He ended up taking on leadership role of group (Queensboro Hill Civic Association). 00:46:57 Although considered a great honor, job was unpaid. Began to run the civic as he saw fit. Gathered political and elected officials as guest speakers, held candidatesÕ forums. 00:48:15 Believes that a good civic runs with good community participation, in theory.  Has found it difficult to get the degree of participation he would like. But, he finds that a group is influential if it appears to be Ð perception is a big part of reality. 00:50:15 Different groups discuss a multitude of issues such as zoning, congestion, transportation, parks, relations to other institutions, and more. 00:51:09* In his civic group, there is no single pressing issue right now. One concern is New York Hospital Queens, which is a world-class hospital in community. There are concerns with congestion, parking, littering, etc. The hospital wants part of Kissena Corridor Park (next door) for parking, as it plans on adding a new cancer treatment center.  00:53:21 As part of conservancy for the park, Capalbi and his group want a meditation garden across the street from park. 00:54:19 He suggested to hospital that they make an offer to take this park for parking and provide other parkland elsewhere in Flushing. As leader of local community, Capalbi stated he would support this concept. Would be a win-win situation. 00:55:18 Other local issues include stores with no signs in English. 00:56:22 Capalbi didnÕt move from Astoria to Flushing. He was living on Upper West Side of Manhattan at the time. He closed down a business and moved back to Queens. But he has owned his house in Flushing for about 35 years, with his mother living there; he lived there off and on over the years. When he married a second time, they lived in several areas of the West Side. 00:57:57 Was inspired to buy in Flushing for his mother: he wanted a location conveniently close to transportation and shops. 00:58:42 Intersection Don lives by is close to the Long Island Expressway and Main Street, a few blocks from New York Hospital Queens. 00:59:28 Asian influx was unexpected, but he feels it saved Flushing. 01:02:03* Capalbi has worked in many different businesses. As a young man, he worked at the (1964) WorldÕs Fair while going to Manhattan College. Outside the placement office, there was a list on a bulletin board with 10 companies that were to be at the WorldÕs Fair. He wanted a summer job. 01:02:42* Used his typewriter to compose a letter and sent a copy to each of those companies, one of which was Post Houses Inc. That was the only response he received. 01:03:13 This company was going to run the Rheingold Exhibit and the Greyhound Pavilion at the WorldÕs Fair. Capalbi corresponded with the personnel director at the company. He was offered a job as assistant manager at the Rheingold Pavilion, which was a food services operation. 01:03:58* The Greyhound Bus Company conglomerate had a food service division with three food service companies: one was Post Houses, which took its name from the rest areas that stage coaches would stop at. 01:04:36 The operation became a huge success. Capalbi ended up supervising 165 employees at age 19. Job started in April and ended in November, as that was when the Fair ran. Was also going to school full-time and struggled to keep up with classes. 01:05:21 Managed to obtain good grades, was 200th of a point below cum laude. 01:06:30 His job at the WorldÕs Fair was not a prestigious job, but it was fun, lots of young people working there. Half the employees were female, one of whom he married. 01:07:10* After graduating college, Capalbi started working for Metropolitan Life. They offered 10 jobs for college graduates for fast-tracking in the company: worked in the accounting department, but it wasnÕt for him. 01:07:41* Rheingold Pavilion was a street in turn-of-the-century New York City. Featured an outdoor park with two bandstands from which food was served. There was also a street that ran through the pavilion with food carts. 01:08:13 There was a strip of buildings in turn-of-the-century style, which ran food services operations via a tavern at one end and a sit-down restaurant at the other. 01:08:40 Capalbi ran the outside operation. It was a turn-of-the-century New York theme park, no rides. Attractions included old-fashioned car for photographs. There was also a bandstand and a couple of kiosks for food. 01:09:40 The atmosphere was fun for everyone. It was especially fun for him to work there with other young people. His favorite pavilions were Schaefer, Ford, GM, and AT&T. 01:11:52 Capalbi took his next job, after Metropolitan Life, at Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, N.J., but decided instead to work as an assistant manager in a pancake house on Long Island.  01:13:00 He did not want to give up his life for a career. Would like to live more comfortably, but feels itÕs better to have less money and enjoy your life. 01:13:38 Capalbi believes there is a satisfaction to the immediate results, immediate ramifications of what you are doing, in food service. ItÕs a gut-level job, dealing with people instead of paper. 01:15:40 Even supervising groups of restaurants still has that contact to people. 01:16:00 Capalbi wanted something else to do. He enjoyed travel and wanted to work for a travel agency. 01:16:13 Found it is a terrible industry to work in unless you have a niche or a relationship with a conglomerate. Commissions very low. 01:16:40 He had an Internet client and walked him through lots of information, but the client ended up booking elsewhere for $13 less. 01:17:37 He assists a British couple, both of whom are blind, with their travel arrangements. He was a member of SATH (Society for Accessible Travel and Hospitality), from which he got this referral. 01:18:34* Capalbi had become a volunteer at MayorÕs Office for People with Disabilities.  Was a member of the Queens and Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce as a travel agent. Once or twice a year, the five borough chambers come together: he attended one meeting in Staten Island at the Yankees ballpark. 01:19:02 The president of the Brooklyn chamber spoke and introduced Matt Sapolin, who was the commissioner at the MayorÕs Office for People with Disabilities.   01:19:25 When no one was around, Capalbi went up to speak with Sapolin, and eventually Sapolin put Capalbi on a volunteer committee at the office; he served on that committee for 8 years. 01:19:47 Matt was blind from childhood cancer and died a year before this interview.  Cancer resurfaced at the age of 41 and he passed away after about three years. 01:20:36* Because he became associated with people with disabilities, Capalbi became a member of SATH, and then he worked with the woman who runs the New York Office for SATH. 01:22:00 If he could have afforded to live on Park Avenue in Manhattan, he would have. 01:22:22 Looked at other communities where he would prefer to live: found Flushing to be dynamic, with good access to the city and Long Island. 01:23:32 Character of Queens: Likes the diversity of Queens and the city in general. 01:24:12 Enjoys multicultural performances, especially by high schools such as Townsend, with kids from different cultures. 01:24:25 At East-West School, Chinese students will perform an act in the African-American style, African-American students perform something Korean, etc. At Lunar New Year Parade at Town Hall, people danced to Columbian music. 01:25:07 He went out with a Costa Rican girl, Egyptian girl, African-American girl, and a Filipino. 01:25:30 Capalbi feels that people who live in New York may better understand the joy of mixing with people from different cultural backgrounds. 01:26:28 To Capalbi, the development of Willets Point on both sides of Citi Field is the best thing to develop and change in Queens in years. Development of public spaces and parks there, will take a number of years to mature. 01:27:00 There is a plan for retail development where the parking lot of Citi Field is. The mayor has selected the same developer he always selects to develop that. There has already been improvement in clean-up of creek. 01:28:40 Retail development will be the first focus; ground may turn out to be too contaminated for housing. 01:29:53 Feels that living in Queens is great. Who knows how large population really is, if all undocumented residents were counted? 01:29:59 Mother still considers herself an immigrant.
