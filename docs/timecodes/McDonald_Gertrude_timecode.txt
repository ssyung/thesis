Looking forward to her 95th birthday in August, 2011, Gertrude McDonald shares some memories from a lifetime of activity in Sunnyside, Queens.  She moved as a little girl in 1923 to one of the first large apartment buildings in the area and played with her friends in the empty fields surrounding the building.  They had steam heat, unlike the cold water flats prevalent in Manhattan and Brooklyn at the time, so it felt like a real move up to live in the developing neighborhood. Her father was a member of the electrician’s union and struggled to find work during the Great Depression. The family moved in for a time with her uncle in Corona, Queens, but quickly moved back to Sunnyside when the economy turned around. Mrs. McDonald met her husband in Sunnyside and they raised their family there. When her children were school-age, Mrs. McDonald began her involvement with community activism. With enthusiasm, she tells of her efforts to improve the safety and quality of her neighborhood and how various public officials have come to know her as reasonable, but relentlessly persistent for her cause. Mrs. McDonald is still an active member of her local Community Board and a leader at the Sunnyside Community Service Center where she spends most of her weekdays.    *00:00:00 First moving with family to Sunnyside, 1923  *00:04:50 The Great Depression, father lost electrician job 00:05:30 Street names vs. numbered streets, used to live on Caroline St. 00:06:20 Life during World War II, dance halls 00:07:15 Meeting her husband at a dance hall *00:08:12 Her husband’s career, rose from page boy to vice president in Chemical Bank, got his degree at night over 10 years 00:10:00 Living in Metropolitan Houses (again) after her marriage, now called the Cosmopolitan Houses 00:11:30 Celtic Park, used to go there, current efforts to memorialize it *00:12:50 Neighbors were all friendly, men and women socializing separately, doors unlocked *00:14:40 Safety in Sunnyside, lobbying for more police officers, postcards to City Hall *00:18:20 First community activist activities, stoplight for school children 00:22:00 Fighting the narcotics rehab center being built and ending up on the board *00:24:00 Running for political office in 1968, first woman to run, lost a close election 00:28:30 Being on the community board, how she was selected 00:29:00 People come to her for help with their problems, she likes helping 00:30:45 Co-founder of Sunnyside Community Service Center, on advisory council 00:32:30 Moving from Sunnyside after taking a fall in her old home, lives in Forest Hills 00:34:00 Struggles of getting older, turning 95 in August of 2011 00:35:10 Influx of Spanish-speaking people in neighborhood, ethnic change over time 00:36:40 Location of original library, moved to Greenpoint Ave., now on 43rd St. 00:37:00  “The Cosmopolitan” was responsible for Span 00:38:34 The Catholic Churches she has attended in Sunnyside 00:39:50  Her children went to St. Teresa’s School, she went to public school 00:40:00 Remembering daily life, ice in the dumb waiter, deliveries, local stores, services 00:44:40 Going into Manhattan to see her grandmother on 86th St. on the east side, & to see friends, went to school in Manhattan until she was 8 yrs. old
