Levent Cimkentli describes his family’s strong connections to the World’s Fair. They arrived in the U.S. in 1963, and his father’s first job on American soil was as a janitor at the Ford exhibit. Though he has no personal recollections of the Fair (since he was only a year old), he describes his family’s sense that the Fair was part of the “promise of tomorrow” and that it was a magical place. He also talks about his own collection of World’s Fair memorabilia, including several items related to the Hall of Magic and the magicians who performed at the Fair as well as the prized piece in his collection, a photograph from the 1939 Fair. He also expresses his hope that the New York Pavilion will be restored to its former grandeur. 00:00:00  Introduction  00:00:25  Story about his family; They had been refugees in World War II and emigrated to the US in 1963; Lived in Indiana briefly but moved to New York to find work in the immigrant community; Father’s first job was a janitor at the Ford pavilion at the World’s Fair  00:01:40*  No personal recollection of the Fair (was only 1 year old), but remembers his parents’ and siblings’ sense of the “promise of tomorrow” and how important the Fair was to them  00:02:11  Brief description of his siblings and their love of the World’s Fair  00:02:42*  Sees the World’s Fair as his own birthplace; Cimkentli has just turned fifty himself; Loves the symbolism of the Unisphere  00:03:14  Describes the thrill of seeing the buildings that are still standing and the hope of renovating the New York Pavilion structures; Description of architect Philip Johnson and his influence  00:04:30  Memories from his father about working at the World’s Fair; His father loved taking the kids to ride around in the cars at the Ford exhibit  00:05:22  Discussion of his personal collection of World’s Fair memorabilia; Description of prized piece in the collection, a photograph of the Trylon and Perisphere from the 1939 Fair taken by a photographer named Adel (or Edel)  00:06:05  Description of the Hall of Magic run by Mark Wilson; Other magicians (the Amazing Randy, Jimmy Ray) performed at the Hall of Magic; Cimkentli has the postcards with instructions for magic tricks  00:07:05  Continued description of Cimkentli’s private collection of World’s Fair souvenirs and memorabilia  00:07:49  Aside about David Copperfield and the Magic Magazine which posted the film of the Hall of  Magic’s show from the 1964 Fair  00:08:25  Description of Mark Wilson’s recreation of one of the magic shows from the 1964 World’s Fair; Wilson pictured in the current Queen’s Museum exhibit holding a top hat with the Unisphere coming out of it  00:09:37*  Description of how and why the World’s Fair grounds are so special to him; Description of it as a magical playland that was very special to his family as the first place they came after moving to America
