Levent Cimkentli describes his familyÕs strong connections to the WorldÕs Fair. They arrived in the U.S. in 1963, and his fatherÕs first job on American soil was as a janitor at the Ford exhibit. Though he has no personal recollections of the Fair (since he was only a year old), he describes his familyÕs sense that the Fair was part of the Òpromise of tomorrowÓ and that it was a magical place. He also talks about his own collection of WorldÕs Fair memorabilia, including several items related to the Hall of Magic and the magicians who performed at the Fair as well as the prized piece in his collection, a photograph from the 1939 Fair. He also expresses his hope that the New York Pavilion will be restored to its former grandeur. 00:00:00  Introduction  00:00:25  Story about his family; They had been refugees in World War II and emigrated to the US in 1963; Lived in Indiana briefly but moved to New York to find work in the immigrant community; FatherÕs first job was a janitor at the Ford pavilion at the WorldÕs Fair  00:01:40*  No personal recollection of the Fair (was only 1 year old), but remembers his parentsÕ and siblingsÕ sense of the Òpromise of tomorrowÓ and how important the Fair was to them  00:02:11  Brief description of his siblings and their love of the WorldÕs Fair  00:02:42*  Sees the WorldÕs Fair as his own birthplace; Cimkentli has just turned fifty himself; Loves the symbolism of the Unisphere  00:03:14  Describes the thrill of seeing the buildings that are still standing and the hope of renovating the New York Pavilion structures; Description of architect Philip Johnson and his influence  00:04:30  Memories from his father about working at the WorldÕs Fair; His father loved taking the kids to ride around in the cars at the Ford exhibit  00:05:22  Discussion of his personal collection of WorldÕs Fair memorabilia; Description of prized piece in the collection, a photograph of the Trylon and Perisphere from the 1939 Fair taken by a photographer named Adel (or Edel)  00:06:05  Description of the Hall of Magic run by Mark Wilson; Other magicians (the Amazing Randy, Jimmy Ray) performed at the Hall of Magic; Cimkentli has the postcards with instructions for magic tricks  00:07:05  Continued description of CimkentliÕs private collection of WorldÕs Fair souvenirs and memorabilia  00:07:49  Aside about David Copperfield and the Magic Magazine which posted the film of the Hall of  MagicÕs show from the 1964 Fair  00:08:25  Description of Mark WilsonÕs recreation of one of the magic shows from the 1964 WorldÕs Fair; Wilson pictured in the current QueenÕs Museum exhibit holding a top hat with the Unisphere coming out of it  00:09:37*  Description of how and why the WorldÕs Fair grounds are so special to him; Description of it as a magical playland that was very special to his family as the first place they came after moving to America
