92-year-old Annalou Christensen (née McQuilling)’s parents  purchased the lot for their home in the 1920’s from the original  developers of the Waldheim Neighborhood in Flushing, Queens. Her  father was from New Orleans and her mother was from New England.  Annalou’s family has a long history in America, including a McQuilling  who fought in the Civil War. As a child, she remembers neighbors  renting out rooms in their mansions for extra income during the Great  Depression.  McQuilling married her neighbor, Wayne Christensen whose  family settled into the neighborhood in 1936 when both he and Annalou  were freshmen on different campuses of St. John’s College. Annalou and  Wayne had two children before Wayne left to fight in WWII like many  of their friends and neighbors. When Wayne returned home safely from  the war, he and Annalou went on to have five more children. They lived  in a house her father bought for her in a handshake deal over the  backyard hedge shortly after her marriage. Annalou went back to school  for her masters degree in education after her last child was born and  became one of the first Special Education teachers in the nation,  pioneering teaching techniques for children with special needs.  Mrs. Christensen remembers many aspects of daily life in  Flushing over nine decades from the ice delivery trucks she chased as a  child in the summer to a
