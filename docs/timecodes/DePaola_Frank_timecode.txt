My name is Frank DePaola and we are in Sorriso Salumeria.  We’ve been here for 33 years, and we specialize in hard-to-get items.  Cheese, fresh-baked breads, sausages, meats, whatever you need.  I was born in Calabria.  I came over here when I was eight years old and have been here ever since.  We moved to Long Island and then we came here to Astoria.    It used to be quiet [this part of the street] until I got here!  We support each other.  We have the bakery, the liquor store, and we all support each other.  Most of them have [been here as long as we have].  I have importers that we use.  Sometimes people want a special item and I ask them to bring it in for me and they do.  Nothing’s hard to get anymore.  It’s actually easier to get stuff from Europe than it was 10 years ago.  Everything is computerized, everything is faster, it doesn’t take as long to approve labels and everything.    My personal food favorite food here has got to be a homemade mozzarella.  You’ll have to try some.  We make it every hour.  We also do a lot of catering, a lot of prepared foods as you saw.  We have a whole showcase-full.  If someone walks in off the street and needs a piece of lasagna, a couple of meatballs, we put it together, you know.  Our catering is really good, we do a lot of catering.  We do parties, we do Kaufman Studios, we do Silver Cup.    We’ve been here 33 years.  My wife doesn’t work here with me.  Better that way!    For some customers I’m on my third generation.  Yeah.  I have the grandparents, and the kids coming here and now the kids are coming here with their kids.  It’s nice to see people grow, and have their own families.  It’s rewarding.    Not yet! [nothing that find a challenge so far].  I love this business so I don’t consider it coming to work every day.  I love food, and I love everything about it.  And I love creating food.   The Italian community here used to be bigger. They’ve gotten older, they’ve moved away, some went back to Italy, some left us.  But we do have a lot of their children here now coming with their children.  And we also have an influx of younger people moving into the neighborhood – 25, 35 years old, young professionals.  They know good food, they love good food, they’ve been brought up on the food network so they already know what to expect when they come in to buy something.    Especially with the computer…people know where to come.  Like we’re on Yelp, so that guy who was just here, he was going to the airport, and he typed in Italian food and we came up.  He was from Texas and he was on a layover.  And that’s happened quite a few times.    So everything is faster than I remember it years ago.  As my son says, “Dad it’s the computer age.”  I mean I’m not a computer guy.  But yeah, absolutely [it helps the business].  Twice as fast.   We’re open seven days a week.  I’m off on Wednesdays and the rest of the time I’m here.  So I give a lot to the store.  190%.  That’s why I’ve been here so long because I’m on top of everything.  You have to be.  I mean I can leave, my son’s with me now, he just finished college so he’s with me now.  So I can relax just a little bit.  But I’m doing something else!  It’s like when I’m off, I’m out getting stuff, or I’m going to the bank, you know it’s always something.    I haven’t been back to Italy since I’ve been here.  But I do plan to do that.  It was 1966 we came.  I could leave seven to ten days but I’m so attached I can’t leave!  My wife says I’m crazy, but it’s my passion, I love it.  This has been my dream, so…why not?
