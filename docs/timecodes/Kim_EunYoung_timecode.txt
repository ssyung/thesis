They are currently making plans to purchase the property outright. Although she finds Flushing very convenient for public transportation and for being able to find Korean food, Ms. Kim feels that Flushing lacks a sense of community and can feel cold.

She calls New York City to a heaven for new immigrants.  01:01:40 Ms. Kim believes that the area of Queens she currently resides will not change that drastically in ten years. Although old homes are torn down for newer buildings, she feels like in thirty years one will still be able to revisit memories of former Queens. She notes that she wants New York City to become a place where new immigrant families donÕt have to worry about being displaced. She hopes that in ten years New York will become a place where immigrant families will be welcomed and can flourish 1:05:25 America is a country that rewards those with passion and dedication with good opportunities.
