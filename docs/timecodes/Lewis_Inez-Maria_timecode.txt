Inez Lewis came to Queens with her parents, her brother and her sister.         They lived at 119th road in Baisley Park, and then moved to 124 Avenue where her father built a house. She then got married 4 months after and moved to an apartment in South Ozone Park 134TH street for 3 years then to St. Albans until 1971. They moved to Rochdale in June 1971and lived there for 43 years.  This complex consists of five thousand eight hundred and sixty (5860) apartments, some has terraces and comprised of one, two and three bedrooms. The population is twenty five thousand (25000) people which consists of predominantly black, such as Hispanic, West Indians, Haitians, and less than one percent white. The white Jews used to be the predominant race but they have moved out of the area, the synagogue on 137 Avenue is now a Unity Church while the synagogue on Baisley was turned into a Montessori school.  In the early days there were only mountains and tunnels where children could play, but the city took the land and turned it into parks, tennis courts and basketball court. They usually host tennis tournament on Memorial weekends and on Labor Day each year.  There are many activities for seniors in the community, but her complaint is that there is nothing for teenagers. She was married and is now a widow since 2000, has one son who has 3 children.  00:01:57 Lived in Rochdale 43 years  00:02:02 Rochdale 5860 number of apartments  00:02:18 Approximately 25000 people  00:02:34 Single mothers and older persons 00:02:42 Blacks, West Indians, Hispanic, Haitian,White 00:03:17 Polish family 00:03:26 2 Synagogue address, Migration of Jews, Churches take over synagogues 00:04:23 Lived since 1971 00:04:54 Mountains and tunnels kids play Kids broke windows 00:05:23 City property City decide to develop land, Tennis court Basketball court 00:05:51 Trees prevent view 00:06:17 Tennis tournaments, brings people from all over, Sit on terrace and watch all the tennis games.
