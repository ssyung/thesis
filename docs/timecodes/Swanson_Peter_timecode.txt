Peter Swanson describes his favorite memories from the 1964 World’s Fair, which he attended several times. He mentions that his parents had attended the 1939 Fair and spoke fondly of the innovations of the future they had seen there. He also points out some of his distinct memories, including the IBM pavilion’s typewriters, seeing the Pieta before it was damaged, and the push-button phone booths that everyone was fascinated by.
