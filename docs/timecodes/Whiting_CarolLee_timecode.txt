Carol B. Whiting, an African American who is very nostalgic about her childhood, has lived her entire life (except for three and a half years) in Flushing, mostly in the same large house.  She fondly recalls “back in the day” when neighbors were close, shopping was local, her mother sewed her clothes and preserved fruits, and the area was country-like.  This changed in the 70s when people of different cultures arrived.                            In a follow up phone interview, she gave details of her educational route to teaching—Queens College, Hofstra B.A. and, more than a decade later, a Masters in Counseling and Education from St. Johns.   00:00:42   Grew up in 11 room house lived in by five generations—Great grandmother, grandmother, parents, Carol, her son.

All knew others by name, left doors open.  00:06:02  Coal delivered to bin. Dad used branches and paper to set up furnace.   00:08:42   In 1950s switched to other heat.

Parents worked as domestics.    00:33:57   Parents returned to Flushing to paternal grandmother’s house.  Mom then only worked part time, did most of housework, and then Carol did it.  00:39:11   Flushing was more country-like than Bed-Stuy which was very clean.                 00:40:55   Kissena Park -- Storybook bridge on pond, concerts, picnics...
