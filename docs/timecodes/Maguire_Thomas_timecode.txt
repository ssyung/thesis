Tommy is an Irish immigrant who came to New York in 1971 because he was appointed the godfather to his sisterÕs daughter. He recalls growing up on a farm in the countryside of Ireland in County Cavan with his family of six. He talks about his school days, his teachers, and his classes. He lived in London before coming New York. His first job was cleaning windows until he became a maintenance man in Manhattan. He wants his grandchildren to know that when he came to New York he had to work hard and be dedicated and he wants them to stay in contact with their Irish relatives across the pond.  00:00:13 Thomas came to the US at the age of twenty-five in October of 1971 to be godfather to one of his nieces. His brother-in-law had a job for him at a Power Plant Building on 45th street in Woodside. 00:00:53  Thomas had worked in London so when he came to New York, he missed it because of the great social life there. But once he got around to going to clubs, he met a lot of great people and decided to stay.    00:01:16  When he first arrived he lived with his sister in Sunnyside for a year and a half. Then he got an apartment in the Woodside/Sunnyside area with his brother who came back from Ireland. They lived together for a couple of years until he got married. 00:01:34  Before marriage, Thomas would go to the Red Mill Club in the Bronx. To get there, he would have to take the 7 Train to Grand Central and then the 4 Train Uptown to 104th street. He wasnÕt used to taking public transportation so at every stop he would look out the window. Once he got to his stop, he began looking around when he spotted an African American man wearing blue transit clothing. Thomas didnÕt ask him anything but the man pointed at a building with a green roof, he recognized that he was Irish and figured that was the place he was looking for. The Club eventually closed down since that area didnÕt have a lot of Irish anymore. 00:03:25  Thomas was from a small country area called Land Galvin and County Cavan in Ireland. He was raised on a small farm, where his Dad took care of the farm and his mom took care of the family and cooked. They built a picnic area about fifteen years ago on the hillside. ItÕs an area where people gather to have a picnic. His grandfather, John Eddy Rodger Maguire, he was the last native speaker in West Cavan thatÕs why they dedicated this area to him. ThereÕs a three mile hike where you can see the three counties, Fermanagh, Leitrim and Cavan.  00:04:55  Thomas has two brother and two sisters. His oldest sister came to the US when he was very young, he barely remembered her. He got to meet her once again when he moved to New York. She would come back to Ireland to visit with her seven kids. His other sister lives in Sunnyside Gardens with seven kids since the 1960s. His brother lived in Woodside and College Point, now heÕs retired and living in the Catskills. His oldest brother lives back in Ireland, running the family farm.  00:06:20  Thomas thought about moving back to Ireland when he came here but when he was growing up there was no employment. So he went to England and later America to get work.  00:06:50  He went to an old fashioned, small school with less than thirty students. When he started in his first year of school, there were two teachers. As the number of students went down, there was only one teacher. There were two rooms in the school, the big room and the small room. He had the same teacher for eight years. He studied English, Irish, Math, and religious instructions. His teacher would always call him T˜mas which was Gaelic for Thomas.  00:08:38  He studied up until 8th grade and at the age of fourteen went to St. PatÕs College in Cavan. Though it was a college it would be similar to a high school here. He went there for two years. They taught him Greek, History, Geography, and Latin. His Greek teacher became a Bishop later on.  00:09:58  After school ended, he stayed home to help his dad at the farm. At 18, he moved to England with his friends as a plumber and a factory worker.  00:10:30  He went back to Ireland before he moved to America because his sister had a child in New York. His brother-in-law had a job ready for him.  00:11:15  He got a job cleaning windows in Woodside for his sisterÕs mother-in-law and all her friends.  00:12:20  He thought New York was busy and he found the people he worked with liked Irish people.  He had a diverse set of bosses. He worked for 40 years with the same company in 1972. He was a maintenance man 00:13:45  He has been retired for 3 years. He has 3 grandchildren. He picks them up from school 00:14:15  He would like for his grandchildren to know that they (the Irish) started off ok but then make a decent living by hard work and dedication and he would like his grandkids to keep in contact with their relatives in Ireland 00:15:05  He is a member of the Cavan Association and the United Irish Counties and he has been a member of St. Sebastian Church for 23 years 00:15:30  He marches in the St. PatrickÕs Day parade.  00:16:00  He says ÒThank youÓ in Gaelic.  Clips Information Who Knew Cleaning Windows Paid So Much In Marker - 00:00:18 Out Marker - 00:03:24 In Marker Ð 00:04:54 Out Marker Ð 00:06:18 In Marker Ð 00:10:31 Out Marker Ð 00:12:15 TommyÕs Life in the British Isles In Marker Ð 00:03:24 Out Marker Ð 00:04:53 In Marker Ð 00:06:18 Out Marker Ð 00:10:31 TommyÕs Life in New York In Marker Ð 00:12:17 Out Marker Ð 00:16:05
