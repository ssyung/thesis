In her own words, Jean Bartelt is Òa Queens girlÓ who has lived almost her entire life in the same Hollis home her German immigrant parents bought in 1935.  She has served people of the borough as both teacher and librarian.

[Was in Student Christian Association], then as college junior joined Gamma Sigma Sigma, service sorority.  Got hurt in college guard houseÑmissed classes.   00:54:55 Political life at Queens College subdued although country Òhopped upÓ versus communism.  Mother afraid of loyalty oaths.  TeacherÕs exams included loyalty oath, speech test, and obscure questions.  00:56:42 MS in Ed thesis on German-American Carl Schurz and Civil service.   01:00:30 Gamma Sigma Sigma (above) took out children from Ottley Home Had fun, too. 01:01:37 Specific memories: ¥ Telephones had no dial tone. You gave number to operator. Hollis exchange now 718. ¥ ÒStores were owned by people.Ó  Mother sent you with list to ÒSam.Ó   Each neighborhood had own cluster-grocery, bakery, etc. ¥  Fountain pens used. ¥ Local movie: Bellaire  on Jamaica Avenue became rifle club, now charter school ¥ Milk delivery by horse drawn wagon.  Horse, Tony, knew route. ¥ Got first TV in 1952.  Before then watched tiny black and white set at aunt and uncleÕs. 01:07:11   Reading:  Read books about Indians because of affinity to Native Americans, and Sue Barton series when thinking of being a nurse.  First book from adult room was Forever Amber. Liked long books and historical books.   Some authors blacklisted as Òpinko.Ó  01:10:12 Political--West coast part of family Òextremely RepublicanÓ yet one was conscientious objector. Also religious split.  Thinks grandmother was socially awareÑbought large American flag after war.  Mother voted for Norman Thomas, fought for education, to get Hollis Library, other causes.  01:15:30 Queensboro Public LibraryÑStarted at Baisley Park (problems).

Misses being able to help most.  01:23:44   In teaching JB had hoped to convey her love of history.  Her mother had trained at Jamaica [Teacher] Training School. In 70s JB managed church baseball team which led being on Facebook. ÒBeing a disciplinarian was never my strong point.Ó  01:26:41 Safety issues in 70s:  SisterÕs car stolen from driveway, another stolen, too.  JB was mugged. Conditions improved ten years later. Only recently, some break-ins again, wheels stolen from her new car. ÒDrugs may be in area near church.Ó  01:31:36 Politics: In the neighborhood, Òwe no longer talk about politics,Ó Ôthough she and mom used to collect signatures for Democratic Party.  JB later returned to this, petitioning for C. Virginia Fields. Since 2004, Òcountry has been polarizedÓ.   Technology tends to blow things out of proportion.  01:35:18 Jean and sister now about two of the last Caucasians in church.  Earlier, mixedÑIrish, some Italian, and German.  A junior high teacher taught Chanukah song for Jewish boy in class.  01: 39:30 Rockaway school named for Brian Piccolo (Chicago Bears) with half of children from Bayswater, an affluent white community, and half blacks from Redbourn houses.

Sister picked up yeast baking; they still preserve fruit, vegetables. 01:50:33 Sisters no longer go to country place as often as they did.  Jean feels close to history in Connecticut, also volunteers at Queens Historical Society, translating 19th century letters both places. Feels she has another family in John Fulton MitchellÕs whose history she gives.  02:06:03 Biggest change is Òwhole technological revolutionÓ--TV, cinema, cars, and trains.  Trains, buses no longer stop in country place.  Subway was a nickel when Jean was in high school with student pass.  02:07:45 In Jamaica, at GoodwinÕs department store two nice dresses cost $13.  TW Grant sold hot dogs with buttered toasted buns ÐÒa big treat.Ó Personal connection in stores lost.  Harder to run business now.  02:09:21 She and Diana vacationed in St. Johns, BWI (2002 or 03).  Sister now living in Flushing coop may move back home where J has been living alone, with two cats.  02:11:28 Teachers now dress in jeans!  ÒPublic education has been devaluedÓ.   DoesnÕt appreciate charter schools.  Queens College education was free.  Libraries also commercialized, not service oriented.  02:13:40 ÒIÕm a Queens girl.Ó   Grew up learning from diversity.
