In her own words, Jean Bartelt is “a Queens girl” who has lived almost her entire life in the same Hollis home her German immigrant parents bought in 1935.  She has served people of the borough as both teacher and librarian.  Ms. Bartelt is active with the Hollis Presbyterian Church and volunteers for the Queens Historical Society and a historical society in Willimantic, Connecticut where the family has a summer home.  Population is different, but Bartelt feels technology is greatest change in her lifetime. 00:01:11 [Photos Brooklyn and Worlds Fair] Only original family on block still there   Grandfather Robert Gephart (b. 1861) and Elizabeth, both from Germany, they met and married in 1890. Of their seven children, youngest girl Jeanette (b.8/23/05) was Jean’s mother; her father came from Hamburg, Germany before 1930s, married 8/31, bought house 1935.  Jean was born 7/15/38, her sister Diana in 3/15/42.  00:04:26 Every Christmas father set up village in basement he had paneled. 00:05:35 Only played with kids on block.  Mother made matching dresses for Jean and Diana.  Not always happy with little sister, but “by the time we were 13 we became each other’s best friends.” 00:07:36 Always went away in summer.  Then, in 1944 JB’s parents bought old house on 60 acres in Willimantic, Connecticut .Rustic—only got electricity in 1947, road paved in 1950.  Kids “had a blast.’ and mother had vegetable garden, canned food  00:18:27 [Photo] Attended PS 135 Queens .First time Jean chose own dress --for first day of first grade.  00:18:49   WW II—Sugar, meat, gas rationed. Father, as instrument maker at Sperry got extra stamps.   00:20:05 Neighbors Jack and Eddie Bayer. Jack (Navy) had been radio man on 1928 Byrd Expedition to South Pole—gave Jean photos.  Other neighbor, James McNamara, worked for Moore McCormack Lines; supplied info for girls’ school assignments  00:21:39 Before Christmas parents gave them Sears or Montgomery Ward catalogs to choose one toy for Christmas. Once, Aunts Ethel and Emma gave her a Jane Hall doll with suitcase and outfits.   00:22:48    A ministers work with Mohawk ironworkers in Brooklyn and other activities of Hollis Presbyterian Church (which she still attends) led her to want to be a missionary to American Indians.  00:24:12   WW II participation:  Father at defense plant; mother’s brother in law, Ethel’s husband George, was a B29 tail gunner.  Her brothers were Billy, Robbie, Ernie; all siblings except Ethel and Jean’s mom born in 1890s.  Ernie’s son Robert in Navy, Billy‘s son Walter in Seabees in South Pacific.  00:26:19 Mother had been elementary school teacher. At that time, teachers had to leave when pregnant; she returned to teaching when girls were in high school.  00:26:53 World War II Irish kid on block taunted “Herman [her dad’s name] the German.”  Father advised to hit him and he would back her up; it solved issue.  Mother grew up in NYC during WW I when anti-German sentiment was more virulent. 00:28:40   “My father never wanted to hear anymore about Germany after he left.” (Post WW I) Came in 1923 with apprentice machinist papers, did other jobs during Depression.  Mother taught at PS 93.The gave 10% of salaries for poor relief under Hoover.  The kids learned not to ask for much; sister got hand me downs 00:31:45 Sisters rode bikes in street everywhere-- to library, store, choir practice.  00:33:00 Went begging on Thanksgiving, and then changed to Halloween trick and treating. 00:35:27   Professionals on block earned more than her father. North of tracks in 60s “better” side.  A real estate co. preached selling because “black people are coming.”  Two Jewish families came in 50s. Now neighborhood is “wonderfully diverse”-- mostly Hispanic, with blacks from Caribbean, Asians.  Jean admits she doesn’t know many of them, but best neighbor, from Trinidad, keeps tabs on all.  00:40:28 Older one family houses near church on 40x 100 lots being replaced by two family houses. 00:41:11 PS 134 still has auxiliary classrooms, PS 118?, and. PS135 two additions added. 00:42:18   Church--Many activities: Sisters went to ballet and tap. Jean was always (since 9 or 10), in choir and still is, she will celebrate 60 years of membership.  [Photos]  00:43:38 Education: PS 135; Jamaica HS [1956]; Queens College--BA 1960 History major, Secondary Education minor; MS Ed [1963] reversed major/minor. “I’m a Queens product.”  00:44:23 Got JHS teaching license in 1961.  By1970s she found discipline in teaching difficult in Rockaways.  City gave study offer so in 1976 she got MLS, then after long search got (lower salary) job at Queensboro Public Library-- 1978-2003—retiring with 44 years’ service credit.  00:48:51 Aunt Ethel d 2004, just short of 102; Mother 2001 (almost 96); Aunt Emma 1995?  Brothers (J’s uncles) were younger when they passed.  Only she, sister, two cousins remain of that generation.  00:51: 05 No relations in Korean War.  Now, one uncle’s grandson is in the Marines.  Cousins all over U.S., but don’t usually see them; at sister’s 70th birthday, did see some.  00:52:52   Social life at Queens College.  [Was in Student Christian Association], then as college junior joined Gamma Sigma Sigma, service sorority.  Got hurt in college guard house—missed classes.   00:54:55 Political life at Queens College subdued although country “hopped up” versus communism.  Mother afraid of loyalty oaths.  Teacher’s exams included loyalty oath, speech test, and obscure questions.  00:56:42 MS in Ed thesis on German-American Carl Schurz and Civil service.   01:00:30 Gamma Sigma Sigma (above) took out children from Ottley Home Had fun, too. 01:01:37 Specific memories: • Telephones had no dial tone. You gave number to operator. Hollis exchange now 718. • “Stores were owned by people.”  Mother sent you with list to “Sam.”   Each neighborhood had own cluster-grocery, bakery, etc. •  Fountain pens used. • Local movie: Bellaire  on Jamaica Avenue became rifle club, now charter school • Milk delivery by horse drawn wagon.  Horse, Tony, knew route. • Got first TV in 1952.  Before then watched tiny black and white set at aunt and uncle’s. 01:07:11   Reading:  Read books about Indians because of affinity to Native Americans, and Sue Barton series when thinking of being a nurse.  First book from adult room was Forever Amber. Liked long books and historical books.   Some authors blacklisted as “pinko.”  01:10:12 Political--West coast part of family “extremely Republican” yet one was conscientious objector. Also religious split.  Thinks grandmother was socially aware—bought large American flag after war.  Mother voted for Norman Thomas, fought for education, to get Hollis Library, other causes.  01:15:30 Queensboro Public Library—Started at Baisley Park (problems). Worked/substituted at about half (32) of system’s branches.  Upon retirement praised for personal touch—feels computers cut that.  01:19:22 Service: • Gamma Sigma Sigma  in college  • Top Ladies of Distinction -- Beautification Chair. • Ruling Elder at church for three terms.  01:20:41 Serving at QBPL—Read many genres to help customers At Fresh Meadows, start of merchandising, “Teen Turf” and at Windsor Park organized book sales.  Misses being able to help most.  01:23:44   In teaching JB had hoped to convey her love of history.  Her mother had trained at Jamaica [Teacher] Training School. In 70s JB managed church baseball team which led being on Facebook. “Being a disciplinarian was never my strong point.”  01:26:41 Safety issues in 70s:  Sister’s car stolen from driveway, another stolen, too.  JB was mugged. Conditions improved ten years later. Only recently, some break-ins again, wheels stolen from her new car. “Drugs may be in area near church.”  01:31:36 Politics: In the neighborhood, “we no longer talk about politics,” ‘though she and mom used to collect signatures for Democratic Party.  JB later returned to this, petitioning for C. Virginia Fields. Since 2004, “country has been polarized”.   Technology tends to blow things out of proportion.  01:35:18 Jean and sister now about two of the last Caucasians in church.  Earlier, mixed—Irish, some Italian, and German.  A junior high teacher taught Chanukah song for Jewish boy in class.  01: 39:30 Rockaway school named for Brian Piccolo (Chicago Bears) with half of children from Bayswater, an affluent white community, and half blacks from Redbourn houses.  Bartelt learned Spanish to help kids in other schools; her parents had insisted she and sister speak English at home.  01:43:42 1982, Jean visited mother’s relatives in Germany, struggled with language but treated royally. 01:46: 18 German food:  Pot roast with red cabbage, apples: Soup with egg drops: Asparagus with cream sauce, bread crumbs; Liver and kidneys; Fricassee chicken with dumplings. Sister picked up yeast baking; they still preserve fruit, vegetables. 01:50:33 Sisters no longer go to country place as often as they did.  Jean feels close to history in Connecticut, also volunteers at Queens Historical Society, translating 19th century letters both places. Feels she has another family in John Fulton Mitchell’s whose history she gives.  02:06:03 Biggest change is “whole technological revolution”--TV, cinema, cars, and trains.  Trains, buses no longer stop in country place.  Subway was a nickel when Jean was in high school with student pass.  02:07:45 In Jamaica, at Goodwin’s department store two nice dresses cost $13.  TW Grant sold hot dogs with buttered toasted buns –“a big treat.” Personal connection in stores lost.  Harder to run business now.  02:09:21 She and Diana vacationed in St. Johns, BWI (2002 or 03).  Sister now living in Flushing coop may move back home where J has been living alone, with two cats.  02:11:28 Teachers now dress in jeans!  “Public education has been devalued”.   Doesn’t appreciate charter schools.  Queens College education was free.  Libraries also commercialized, not service oriented.  02:13:40 “I’m a Queens girl.”   Grew up learning from diversity.
