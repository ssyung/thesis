Abdel:  We are in the Bakeway New York at 30th Avenue and are just taking coffee and breakfast.  Ahmed: I am Fargahly Ahmed.  We are in Bakeway just now drinking coffee, having breakfast.  Having a nice time.  Abdel: I live around the block for almost 20 years now.   I was born outside, but they [my children] were born here.  I was born overseas in Egypt.  Ahmed: I am twelve.  I go to school five or ten blocks from here.   Abdel: Oh yes the neighborhood has changed.  Especially the area from 21st Street and down to the river.  It's beautiful there now.  Before you couldn't walk over there in the night.  New buildings are coming up now.  Now you have to havea little tiny car just to get a spot to park, not like before.   Really I came to Astoria because I had friends here.    I work in a warehouse - 40 hours a week, I'm getting old now.   Ahmed: I want to be a doctor.  The one that works with the heart.    Abdel: I socialize with Greek, Italian people√âfrom Egypt, Spain, Mexico.  You see a lot of variety, culture everything, you know.   I see that Astoria is much better now - the population is up, so the service is much better.    Ahmed: I really would like to go to live in London!  People go there because doctors go there - I want to be a good doctor.    Abdel: Sometimes we go to different cafes, one Sunday here, the other time the bakery at 32nd, sometimes to 7/11. There are very good places now.  It wasn't before like this.    About five, six years ago it really started to change.  The quality of cafes and restaurants got a lot better.   It's good living here.
