Chris Shand works the 4pm to midnight shift at the Flushing Hospital where his wife also works as a nurse. He grew up in Richmond Hill, Queens in a middle class neighborhood and later lived in upstate New York before returning to Queens. He first moved to Flushing in the 1990’s and has seen populations and housing costs rise dramatically. Chris is a member of the Waldheim Neighborhood Association, a group that sought zoning changes to prevent developers from tearing down historic houses to replace them with large apartment buildings. He and his wife live in an older apartment building just a few blocks from the hospital. 00:00:00 Explains that interview is at the hospital during his shift 00:01:30 Meeting his wife (a nurse) in the 1980’s as an ambulance technician 00:03:52 You can’t tell if someone is from Flushing, very diverse  *00:06:00Brooklyn seemed a foreign place (edit this together with 13:55 clip) 00:07:30 RKO Keith’s in Richmond Hill and Flushing 00:08:10 Old things seem better when you’re older 00:08:30 Living in houses until recently, now in an apartment *00:10:00Houses replaced by high-density apartment buildings, parking problems 00:13:10 Transportation habits: driving/taking the train *00:13:55Distinction between Queens and “the city” (Manhattan) *00:15:25Illegal apartments, can’t afford a house in the area otherwise (edit this together with 10:00 clip) 00:17:00 Recent fire at Phlox and Cherry Ave due to illegal apartments 00:17:40 Overpopulation overwhelms sewage system, schools, housing, parking 00:19:00 Neighborhood association’s battle against developers 00:23:15 Location of his apartment, his view, neighbors selling out to developers 00:26:00 More on overpopulation, neighborhood association’s battle against developers *00:28:40 Love of ethnic diversity, but cultural difficulties at the hospital *00:32:00 How hospitals provide translation services, but it is costly (combine with 28:40?) 00:35:10 His wife grew up Puerto Rican in Jewish area, medical training in Spanish 00:37:45 Compares different hospitals in the area, differences in funding 00:40:58 Religious groups in the immediate neighborhood, he goes to Mary’s Nativity 00:44:55 Previous career as a paramedic in New York *00:47:00 Close relationships with his neighbors wherever he’s lived, diverse neighbors 00:49:20 Crime in the neighborhood is not very bad 00:50:22 Moment when the neighborhood felt like home, neighborhood association 00:54:00 Wants to stay in his current apt. bldg. indefinitely, likes the superintendent 00:55:40 Borders of Waldheim for him, 3-4 block radius from his home 00:57:00 Downtown Flushing’s crowded sidewalks, unpleasant, people rude 00:59:30 Corner posts at Cherry and Bowne struck him as something out of the past 01:01:00 The “insane asylum” back when Waldheim was in the country 01:02:00 Mary Kaiser’s pony farm, fighting the hospital for her property 01:03:00 Tsavalos home was moved during the 1950’s
