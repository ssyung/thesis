Chae Blount A budding author talks about how he started writing and what it has taught him.


00:00:30	I began writing when my mother was pregnant with my younger brother Seth. So My Mom said write a book of tips and then She did all the illustrations. I wrote three books.

00:01:29 One of my teacher Mr.Covarowski was funny. I thought he was putting force on me but he was really just trying to make me a better author.	

00:02:05	The hardest part of my artistic process was coming up with the tips because my tips come from my own imagination.
00:02:30	If I could tell my younger writer self-anything I would tell him to keep trying because god will make a way.
00:03:52 The way my book publishing changed me is because I needed to come up with a new book to write.
