Nilda Tirado has lived with her mother and sister in the Waldheim neighborhood in Flushing since 1972 when she and her sister Rosa Tirado bought their house. This was due in part to an anti-discrimination law that had just passed, allowing women to get mortgages.  They were the first Puerto Rican family in the neighborhood at a time when Ms. Tirado believes Puerto Ricans had a bad reputation in New York City. After a cautious beginning, their neighbors soon accepted the Tirados as part of the community. There are major conflicts around the increase in development in the area, the razing of houses, building of condos, and subway cuts.  Ms. Tirado has experienced aggressive real estate developers who try to buy her house and encroach upon her property.  Other changes occurring in the area include heavier traffic congestion on Main Street.  Ms. Tirado participates in her local community board to address these issues and advocate for improvements that will serve the people, not the developers. Other changes are due to waves of immigration in the area.  Currently there are many Asian immigrants who own local businesses.  Ms. Tirado says residents are frustrated when shopping at these stores because the signs are not in English and they are told varying prices of goods.  However, she says that diversity is good for the area and is one of the aspects of Flushing that she likes. Although Ms. Tirado is not in favor of many of the changes happening in Flushing, she has not considered moving because she owns her house, likes the hospitals, and takes her aunt to church nearby.  She voices concerns about the future and worries that there is a lack of infrastructure and planning to support the increasing population. This interview with Nilda Tirado was recorded in the familyÕs kitchen with Rosa Tirado and their mother, Carmen Miranda sitting at the table, listening.  They are sometimes audible in the recording.  00:00:24 Boundaries of Waldheim neighborhood 00:01:20* Moving into the neighborhood as first Puerto Rican family 00:03:40 Puerto Ricans, New York City and Flushing in the 1950Õs-1970Õs 00:04:40 Experience of searching for and buying their house ($64,000 in early Ô70Õs) 00:06:40 Relations with the neighbors:   - Ethnic origins - How they help each other - Limits to level of intimacy and involvement - Details about various neighbors 00:12:06 Physical boundaries defining their functional neighborhood (where they know people) 00:14:30 Speaking Spanish as a way to get to know neighbors 00:15:00 Religions in the neighborhood 00:17:00 Problem with homes turned into churches 00:19:43 Transportation locally and into Manhattan (what inspires a trip to Manhattan) 00:23:11 Shopping - Where (what stores, what location) - Why they make those choices 00:25:05*  Why they never consider moving despite the changes in the neighborhood 00:26:55  Experience with local hospitals 00:28:50*  Local seniors and other renters getting pushed out by landlords 00:29:54*  Unsolicited offers to buy property in the neighborhood and developer activity 00:34:33*  Remembering the tense rezoning meetings in the Waldheim Association 00:36:52**  Overdevelopment without planning is not progress, gives great example 00:39:10  Houses that sold despite being small 00:39:53  Recent trends and happenings in property sales and development 00:44:08**  Impact of large wave of Asian immigration Ð cultural tension - How downtown Flushing has changed - Traffic congestion - Merchants stopped paying for Christmas decorations 00:53:11  Best possible outcome for FlushingÕs future - Transportation issues - Shopping 00:55:13  Merchant signs different prices in different languages - Assemblywoman Grace MengÕs initiative - Advertisement for call girls in Korean 00:57:40  Infrastructure concerns for Flushing - Train cuts - New ÒluxuryÓ apartments - Sewage system - Schools, especially high schools 1:04:11  How Queens is seen as a borough 1:06:03  Safety in the neighborhood  - Robberies - Gangs - Unsafe drivers 1:10:22  Unlocked doors 1:12:14  Relationship with neighbors - Yard work 1:13:04  Living on a private block and therefore not on the city map 1:17:10  Special events - On the block - Around Flushing area - Puerto Rican Day parade 1:20:10  Visiting 1964 WorldÕs Fair - Long-term impact on Flushing  1:22:55  Absentee landlords detrimental - Room/mattress rentals 1:24:25  Prostitution common and unchecked by the police 1:25:48  Parking issues 1:27:03  Decline in value for trees and lawns 1:28:40  Feeling discrimination as a Puerto Rican at screening of ÒWest Side StoryÓ - 3 Hispanic students in high school
