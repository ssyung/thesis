In this interview, Gerard Tate discusses his life, historical events and how the community of Ridgewood has changed from the early 20th century to the present day.  His formative years coincided with the Great Depression and the Second World War: a period of relative poverty and little mobility.  As he notes, few people frequented areas beyond their immediate neighborhood.  He attended P.S 88, graduated from Grover Cleveland High School in 1953, attended Cornell University and subsequently served on active duty in the army for two years to 1962, before the escalation of the Vietnam War.  Back in Ridgewood, Gerard became a junior high school teacher.  He has also traveled extensively throughout the world.  He notes that today, the community of Ridgewood has become much more diverse; once home to a mostly German population, the neighborhood now has people of Hispanic, Indian, Muslim and Chinese heritage.       00:00:38:  Earliest memories of Queens are of the Vander Ende-Onderdonk home.  Gave a book on this home to Leslie. 00:02:32:  Picture of EidershteinÕs: sister got married in Rackless meadow and had her  reception in Eidersthein (a German restaurant).  Room was not air conditioned: fans run by a central machine.  Real time German establishment; best German food; served the best German food; Zum Stammtisch also very good. 00:03:37:  In early 1900s, Eidersthein was on an old farm road. 00:04:00:  Father was born in 1894.  His uncle owned a funeral parlour in downtown Brooklyn.  Funerals were held there; people in horse drawn carriages would come out on Metropolitan Ave.  People would conduct funeral services in cemetery there and after funeral service in Brooklyn, have funeral lunch in Eidersthein. 00:05:00:  Big debate in German congregation: which restaurant had the best sauerbrauten?  Always settled on EiderstheinÕs instead of Zum Stammtisch. 00:05:31:  Father was born in Brooklyn, mother born in Manhattan.  Consolidation (of the two areas) occurred in 1898.  Can look it up Ridgewood Times. 00:06:20  Paul Curries tried to save Eiderstheins; original owners wanted to sell it but couldnÕt sell very well because it wasnÕt historical anymore.  After the historic part of the building was taken down, the restaurant was no longer considered historic.  Infrastructure was in very bad shape.  It is now an ArbyÕs. 00:07:02  There was a trolley that followed the same route as the B58 (now called Q58):  00:07:43  Trolley/bus start at the Brooklyn side of Wyckoff Avenue.  Labeled D58 (the trolley) or B58 (the bus). 00:07:58  Decided to change bus name to Q58: because it only has stops in Queens (only a block or two in Brooklyn). 00:08:29  During the war, government ripped up rails in many places.  But, they did not extract rails in Fishmond road and under the L train. 00:08:43  Gerard and his friends would put pennies under the rails: the trolley would flatten penny out.  This is similar to the penny souvenir machine. 00:09:27  P.S. 88 during WW2: used to grow victory gardens during first and second World Wars.  Grew tomatoes etc but Gerard doesnÕt have a green thumb 00:10:24  Grandparents were second owners; brought house in 1917.   00:10:50  When mother was born in Manhattan in 1898, used to live in various places in Manhattan.  WasnÕt nice in Manhattan.  So motherÕs parents moved from Manhattan to corner of Seneca and Linden (used to be a drug store there); mother lived block or two behind drug store. 00:11:40  In 1916, mother graduated from teacher training. In 1917, all male teachers gave up munificent teacher salary to work in the war industry.  NYC was center of manufacturing in USA at that time.  Can still see traces of pollution there today;   00:12:00  Friend took him to Gowanus canal for 77th birthday; Newtown Creek Alliance is managing remediating efforts in the polluted canal.  Gerard has visited several different canals in Europe and Asia.   00:13:31 During his trip to the Gowanus canal, Gerard saw a drunk tear through a hill right into the water; HazMat team had to rescue him out of the polluted waters. 00:14:21  FatherÕs family arrived before Civil War; lived in downtown Brooklyn; used to live in the area where they built the telephone building.   00:15:01  Father would go to bars with a metal tin can.  Enter the bar through the side entrance (for kids).  Collect can of beer (liquor) to take to construction workers.  Construction worker lower rope; father put growler on the rope.   00:15:55  Used to call refrigerator an ice box up to the mid 50s. 00:16:05  Depression through WW2: ten year gap where nothing really changed.  Neighborhood didnÕt change; people had little mobility.  No cars whatsoever.  Would play ball in the streets. 00:17:26  Mother got job as a schoolteacher in 1917; income of mother and grandparents pooled to buy house on Linden street (Gerard lives there now). 00:17:58  May walks; Grandmother would organize Maywalk from Seneca to where current house is located; would have May pole celebrations. 00:18:33  Communists co-opted May Day: people donÕt recognize holiday anymore.  No more May walks. 00:19:23  Library of Grover Cleveland (part of Queensborough Public Library I thinkÉ) hasnÕt changed; lighting design is still the same.  Ceiling is exactly the same. 00:20:17  Cathy became chair of education committee.  Got money to put new fluorescent lighting and turned old reference room into a computer lab.   00:21:13  All the people he knew have passed away.  No longer has intimate friends on his block. 00:21:57  Had close friends living on the same block growing up.  Went to same grammar school, church, etc. 00:22:23  Population of Ridgewood was stable up until second World War.  People didnÕt really have any money to move.   00:23:00  Ridgewood was the center of clothing manufacturing for many years (until jobs were outsourced).  People bought fabric and there were a lot of knitting mills.  Women worked in mills.   00:23:50  Women would work in knitting mills and then walk home from the factories.  There were knitting mills of different sizes all over Ridgewood. 00:24:40  Clothing manufacturers went to different countries: Ridgewood wages couldnÕt compete-end of clothing manufacturing in the area. 00:25:32  During War, Military/ Navy employed tens of thousands of people. ConEd employed hundreds of people to perform jobs now done by machines.   00:25:51  Father worked for Brooklyn Edison.  USA entered ww1 in 1917: no man his (fatherÕs) age could stay home; all volunteered for the army. 00:26:26  Father volunteered for the army, even though he had an exempt job.  Never served overseas: was in machine guns training program in Georgia.  Unit was not called; armistice of 1918 ended the war. 00:27:41  Served in army in the 1960s.  Landed at an airport in Georgia (unsure of name).  Walk in through concourse; saw segregation (negro water fountain, white water fountain etc). 00:28:29  Shocked at segregation. 00:28:50  Took bus to Columbus, Georgia to army training center; only saw white people in bus.   00:30:00  Theatre performance of ÒThe Princess and the PeaÓ: only saw white people in the theatre; saw African Americans sitting in the far balcony. 00:31:32  Ridgewood used to be very German; German newspaper, movie theater, 00:31:42   Took German in Cornell. 00:37:22  Was at the infantry in Fort Bennings.   00:37:46  Served as kitchen police at Fort Dicks.  Dished out mashed potatoes.    00:38:41  Classmate from Cornell had degree in English but since he came from College of Agriculture, was assigned to Kansas City as a meat inspector.  Gerard (an Economics major) assigned to infantry magazine.   00:39:43  Served for two years in the Army after he graduated.   00:40:32  Considers himself lucky.  He was too young/had a college exemption for Korea. Also, he served two years on active duty and was already in an inactive role (served as a peacetime soldier) when the Vietnam conflict escalated. 00:41:52  Peeled potatoes with peelers but couldnÕt get the eyes out: had to cut eyes out.   00:42:35  Clean trays; Make sure everything is clean then go back to barracks. 00:43:50  Had fond memories of life in the army; relatively stress-free because it was not wartime. 00:44:28  Knew sergeants who had served in WW2/Korea and still serving in the 1960s. Could talk to eminent individuals one-on-one. 00:45:40  Was able to serve steak to General/President Eisenhower as part of the Ivy League Platoon (Gerard represented Cornell, couple of people from the other Ivies-Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Brown).   00:46:52  Follow me statue for the infantry; General wanted a ÒFollow-meÓ statue holding an M1 gun.   00:49:26  1968: Vietnam War started in earnest.  00:50:16  USA used to be very friendly with Ho Chi Minh; He and the Americans celebrated victory over Japan in WW2.   00:50:50  U.S. was suckered into Vietnam conflict by the French.   00:51:24  U.S. had built World War 2 style Western European army.  The French originally tried to fight the Vietnamese guerilla army with a Western Army.  U.S tried to fight using WW2 style Western European army.  Overall, Gerard observes that you canÕt win a peopleÕs war with this tactic. 00:51:48  We still havenÕt figured out how to fight a guerilla war (Iraq, Afghanistan); Vietnam war was a losing proposition from the start.    00:52:17 Vocal opposition to Vietnam War-talk to Tom Dowd about this. 00:52:30  Growing up, neighborhood was all German.  His family moved to Ridgewood from Manhattan because they wanted to have a yard. Ridgewood was the first suburb community served by trolley (for transportation to Manhattan) 00:53:15  War (first and second world wars) spurred economy. 00:53:26  1960s community was all-German.  German newspaper, radio, German clubs 00:54:25  Children of German immigrants moved out to suburbs and other areas of country.  Neighborhood gradually became Italian and Hispanic.  Records in Catholic church reflect changing demographic. 00:55:00  Now, Eastern Europeans and African Americans are moving in. 00:55:16  Queens is most ethnically diverse neighborhood in the world.  Stunned when he heard Afro-Americans in Queens speaking an African language he heard in Africa. 00:56:36  Came back from Ghana.  During a walk in Flushing Meadow Park, he sees two Ghanaian women sitting on a log selling things just as they do at a marketplace in Accra.  Notes irony: He could have just taken a Q58 bus (probably to Flushing) instead of getting vaccines/traveling 10,000 miles to experience Ghanaian culture.  00:57:14  Went to Ghana to become a schoolteacher.  Sister and brother in law were professors. 00:57:48  Went to Ghana with Museum of African Art.  Director of the trip knew everybody 00:58:18  Stayed in famous five star European style hotel called the Hote d IÕvoire. 00:58:56  European style supermarket in back near hotel. 00:59:30  Went to East Africa with teacherÕs crew.  Noted that when he went for the first time, the society was completely segregated.  People werenÕt really allowed to approach his hotel. 01:00:55  No eggs/chickens in many West African cities unless you imported them from Europe.  Heifer Project built fish ponds/ established indigenous chicken agriculture. 01:01:58  During a trip to West Africa in the 1990s, Gerard was able to observe the beneficial effects of the Heifer Project.  With an abundance of fish ponds (artificial ponds), people were able to consume protein in the form of fish every night.  Women walked around selling eggs. 01:02:40  Went to Africa with a lot of professors.  These included a man based at the museum of African Art, sister professor, etc. 01:03:11  Was reluctant to bargain with the market sellers. 01:03:32  Went to a place and saw women making blankets.  Blanket cost $15.  Gerard asked to pay $14.95.  Settled on $14.99.  Gave $2.00 as a thank you. 01:05:44  Communists took over Ethiopia; killed everybody.   01:05:58  Ethnic divisions in Africa got out of hand; every hotel they (Gerard and his company) stayed at were trashed and featured in the newspapers. 01:06:33  Hote dÕIvoire and supermarket in Cote dÕIvoire was trashed.  Manager asked; ÒWhy are you trashing it?  ItÕs not European.Ó 01:07:12  Graduated from Grover Cleveland High School in 1953.  Grover Cleveland featured on the class ring. 01:07:48  Made hats on Class Day, probably made of cardboard.   01:08:51  Has a 1953 class hat. 01:09:06  Also has a1957 hat from Cornell University (when he was a freshman at Cornell). 01:13:01  55th anniversary of the high school in June 13, 1986; Celebration; people sang old songs about the school. 01:14:01  Became a schoolteacher in Ridgewood after coming back from the army.  Bought house for mom and has been living in Ridgewood ever since. 01:14:32  Taught at junior high school; doesnÕt remember name of the school. 01:14:52  Got involved in politics for John Lindsay (was night mayor for John Lindsay). 01:15:12  When he was night mayor at Paulback City Hall, the nighttime security consisted of himself, Sid Davidoff, Jeff (became head of Disneyland) one police officer, janitor on duty. 01:15:50  Father was involved in politics with grandfather (his fatherÕs father) back before first World War. 01:16:10  Remained Republican until John Lindsay was thrown out of Republican party-became a Democrat afterwards. 01:17:34  Mom would get a phone call-phone call would come to pharmacy.  Messenger kid would come to his mom and tell her she had a job for a day (sounds like mom started as a per diem teacher). 01:18:30  Mom and dad married; lived on second floor of grandparentsÕ house sister was born in 1930.  When grandparents passed away, family took over whole house. 01:19:20  Parents took trip around the world when they retired; traveled extensively. 01:20:02  Was a boy scout for 8 years.  1953: Boy Scout had a jamboree out in California.  Traveled on the BNO Railway (featured in Monopoly game) 01:21:35  Stopped at several places Washington D.C., maybe Kansas City; train station rest stops arenÕt there anymore. 01:22:19  California was building up university campuses.  (Maybe Boy scouts organization) bought a cattle ranch and set up a world-wide jamoboree there. 01:22:58  Stopped at Chicago on the way back. 01:23:24  Carlos Ramulo; president of the Philippines.   01:23:44  Left when Japanese (took over).  Took famous picture with General MacArthur. 01:24:27 Carlos came to USA after the war and was honored by the Boy Scouts.   01:24:59  Gerard was there when Carolos was presented a Scout Honor for being involvement in liberation of Philippines. 01:26:12  Some people criticize McArthur for leaving Corregidor (base in Philippines).   01:27:00  Declared to Filipinos that he shall return.  Was a very inspiring figure 01:28:05  Pearl Harbor and Japanese air raids showed that in war, you could no longer have a battle fleet unprotected by aircraft carriers. 01:28:46  British/American battle fleet tried to stop Japanese takeover of Singapore/Malaya but had no aircraft carrier.  Japan destroyed the fleet.  Consequently, the U.S could not save the Philippines from invasion. 01:29:48  President ordered McArthur to break out. 01:31:35  McArthur flew/retreated to Australia 01:32:38  Remembers December 7th, 1941 very clearly; went out to WorldÕs Fair Ground (ice skating rink); remembers the announcement that all military personnel must report to the nearest military base. 01:33:28  German U-boats torpedoed oil tankers near Rockaway beach; people visiting the beach got their feet dirty from oil clumps. 01:34:26  Enforced blackout sessions in East Coast; as a precaution against German air raids.  Black out shades for home windows during air raid drills. 01:35:10  Air raid warrens come around telling people to keep lights off.  01:37:00  New York City and whole country was static because of depression and war.  Considers himself lucky because his parents kept their jobs during The Great Depression.  The family would go out to Huntington for vacation. 01:38:19  Had first pizza when he was a freshman at Cornell; people did not travel extensively outside of their immediate neighborhood so they were unable to sample different food. 01:39:09  People living in suburbia were more isolated; many didnÕt have telephones and could not really travel to the city. 01:40:23  Very rarely met people from outside your neighborhood.  E.g. you would never meet a Jewish person outside of New York City.   01:41:09  Only three religions in New York: Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism; Students would know that during Catholic holidays, Catholic teachers would take off.  Jewish teachers take off during Jewish holidays. 01:42:34   Now recognize Moslem/ Indian holidays. 01:43:12  Talks about the Mainland Chinese and Taiwanese Chinese conflict over the organization of the Lunar New Year celebrations. 01:44:01  Anniversary Day in Ridgewood: anniversary of the founding of the Sunday School Union.  Churches had Anniversary Day parade consisting of thousands of Sunday school students; parade of many blocks. Schools in Queens and Brooklyn were closed for that day (this eventually became Brooklyn Queens day). 01:44:52  Hundredth anniversary was the last organized parade-extremely low turnout; mostly senior citizens came out.   01:46:35  Rockefeller (mayor?) signed a bill that mandated Brooklyn Queens day as a holiday.   01:47:32  A lot of churches that used to be around are no longer there.  For example, there used to be a church right across the street from a McDonaldÕs: attendance progressively decreased until the church had to be de-sessioned. 01:49:56  GerardÕs church was started by Germans that moved to Queens from Brooklyn and Manhattan.  Used to have services in German and English until the German pastor left.  01:51:16  Gerard mentions a church behind a bank (maybe Ridgewood Savings Bank) that has become Taiwanese.  Used to be a sisterhood run by Protestant German ÒnunsÓ (women who serve a role similar to that of nuns). 01:54:01  Talks about the P.S. General Slocum disaster: group of German Americans took a boat trip in Manhattan; boat caught on fire.  Many people, mostly consisting of young women, children and the elderly died.   Many of these dead are buried in a cemetery near the site of EiderstheinÕs Restaurant (currently an Arbys).  This disaster precipitated a huge decrease in the German congregation of downtown Manhattan.
