Gail Gordon discusses growing up in the Bronx and moving to Forest Hills, how the neighborhood has changed, and her involvement in the Forest Hills AIDs center beginning in the 1980’s.  00:01:54 I grew up in the Bronx. I went to high school and my first year of college     there. I went to City College.  00:02:43 I moved to Forest Hills in 1978. Before that, I lived a couple other places     in Queens, including Flushing. There were a lot of issues with the Forest     Hills Co-ops.  00:05:18 Old buildings are coming down and bigger ones are being built. Austin Street is becoming more commercial.   00:08:20*         I got involved of in the AIDS center in the early 80’s because I had friends that were gay - AIDs in Forest Hills in the early 80’s was not pretty.  00:10:50  At that time the AIDS center was mostly helping people with the end of their lives. Most of the funding came from the state and the city.  00:12:24           The leaders at the time weren’t that helpful. The only thing people related AIDS  to was being gay. People weren’t as receptive to wanting to help people. Th  AIDS center wanted to open in Glendale, but were told they couldn’t.  00:14:10  Queens was a smaller organization then in Manhattan. The board started to thin out, and only five board members remained due to bad leadership. The remaining board people were working all night to keep it open. Philip Glotzer revitalized the agency. There are now 4 or 5 centers in Queens.  00:17:17    The AIDS crisis at the time was considered a gay men’s disease. Over the years it changed from the gay disease to drug addicts, to anyone being able to get it.  00:19:40  Now the program isn’t helping people die but helping them live.  00:27:23  Melinda Katz and other politicians stepped up and helped the movement.  00:30:53  We had a gay doctor that volunteered with us who worked with AIDS patients at a hospital.  00:32:00*  I had a friend who was just so full of life and then he was diagnosed with AIDS and he just died a few months later.  00:34:08*  There were people who died at 21 or 22. It wasn’t fair it’s not like they went out knowing what was out there. But it’s not fair. It’s not like you can bring them back, all you can do is try and help.  00:43:10  I have been working on the community board for 30 years. One of the important issues we dealt with in Forest Hills was traffic control on Queens Blvd due to all the deaths and taking away parking for a bike lane. Currently a big issue in Forest Hills is the bike lanes.  00:55:30  My hope is for Queens to remain as diverse as it is. That people aren’t priced out of Queens. And that people realize that they are all the same and that they are going to work together. My hope for Queens is that it stays Queens.
