Arnold Franco grew up in Richmond Hill, New York and currently resides in Manhattan. In this interview Arnold discusses his childhood in Queens, his experiences in Queens College, his time serving during World War II and life after the war. Being a Veteran and an Alumnus, Arnold decided to give back to Queens College and those who served in the war with generous donations that helped build a memorial on the campus. Queens College even has a The Arnold Franco Prize for Writing in History.
