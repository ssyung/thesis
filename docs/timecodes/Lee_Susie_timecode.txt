Susie Lee was born in Flushing, Queens to Korean parents.  She recalls her experiences growing up in the neighborhood in the 1990Õs. Because she attended school from 7th-12th grade in Manhattan, she didnÕt develop friendships in Flushing or many ties to the area.  She compares the downtown area around Roosevelt and Main Street to Times Square and liked it better when Flushing was quieter.  She describes the building where her parents and brother still live and some of the neighbors whom sheÕs known for years.  Susie had just moved a month before this interview to Astoria, Queens, but says her family intends to remain in Flushing.  00:00:43 Never knew she lived in Waldheim  00:01:15 Her parentsÕ building where she grew up 00:02:20 Waves of immigration 00:02:50 Her ties to the Korean community 00:03:05 Korean communityÕs move from the neighborhood (00:03:11-00:03:45)     (00:03:50-00:03:54) *00:04:45 The boundaries of Flushing (00:04:58- 00:05:14) *00:05:54 Changes in her lifetime, different people, more crowded (00:05:54-00:06:35) 00:06:40 Lack of relationships across the Asian community 00:07:20 Her motherÕs Korean Church 00:07:50 Her memories of the mansions in the neighborhood 00:08:20 Her aspirations about where sheÕd like to live when she grew up 00:09:10 Going to high school in Manhattan 00:10:30 No neighborhood friends because of her schooling *00:11:10 Flushing is like Times Square, doesnÕt want to live there (00:11:03-00:11:46),    (00:11:59-12:15) 00:12:20 The difference of living 3 minutes apart: population density 00:13:00 Natalie tells Susie about the rezoning efforts in her own neighborhood *00:14:10 Her parents will stay, their living conditions, condition of their building     (00:14:09-00:15:26) 00:16:30 Her parentsÕ jobs, Mom works at post office in Brooklyn, her commute 00:17:40 Her neighbors in the building, the Super and Jeanie 00:18:40 How many people live in subdivided one bedroom apartments  00:19:45 Signs in many languages in the building 00:20:12 Thing that distinguishes Flushing from the rest of Queens: diversity 00:20:44 Most likely outcome for Flushing in the future 00:21:30 Playing at the P.S. 20 Elementary School playground as a girl 00:23:46 Being a Library Studies Student at Queens College 00:24:40 Moving to Astoria
