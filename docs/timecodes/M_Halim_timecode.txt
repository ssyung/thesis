My name is Halim.  I am the owner of Harissa.  I started it nine months ago.  My previous job was as a waiter. Actually as a bus boy.  Periyali, a Greek Restaurant.  Then I worked with the same owner for 10 years as a waiter at Il Cantinori.  10th Street between Broadway and University Place [Manhattan].  When you work for the same time in a long place you think you want to do something else.    Then I went into a partnership with someone in the city but that didnÕt work so I decided to just give up the restaurant business. So I started driving a limo, from 2001 May all the way up to, well for seven years driving.  I was driving almost the same people who I used to wait on.  People who can afford to eat at places like Il Cantinori.  I enjoyed the free time.  I was like outside, IÕd stop, thereÕs no stress because I have only a few customers and I knew the timing.  So you pick them up and drop them, sometimes you spend the whole day with them.   We always had something to talk about and I learned a lot from them.  But at the same time every time I would drive them back to the restaurant to eat I would think ÒI can do this.Ó   But in between I was about to open a place with a friend that I had but I lost almost everything.  I was with an artist.  And you know how artists are very eccentric.  It takes three years to tell all this story.  Then when you lose everything itÕs a shock.  But I said to myself IÕm not going to lose all this.   Then I spent a while driving cabs.  And it was more interesting because you meet the real New York, like the inside.  So you talk and you forget.   I had spent almost 8 months working on it Ð it was in an apartment on Vernon Boulevard. Now everybody has opened next to that place.  At the time I was going to open it there was no-one there.  Everyone had the idea of renting an apartment and making it into a store.   The guy with me was in antiques and there was an idea that you would be able to buy the furniture youÕre sitting on.  I blame him for everything else.  He had an amazing idea but the worst to deal with.  Before we started a business I was the guy who could talk on a phone, get the contracts etc.  I lost money he lost a man, soÉ.  Then this one came up so I said why not.  I was always looking for a place where you could sit and enjoy the coffee, like a Mediterranean menu where you can have from vegetarian to meat etc.   ItÕs inspired by Il Cantinori, because they were serving quality food.  No matter what you do itÕs all about being consistent in the food.  I remember there was a guy there who said 15 years ago I had this pasta and it still tastes the same.  Also the quality.  You see the boxes with the fish, the tomatoes.  ThatÕs what makes it a success.    Then I find that when you walk in a place itÕs the whole atmosphere that counts.  When we were building this place, renovating, we got some lunch Ð I bought a small can of Harissa.  We were sitting on the floor, like in August last year.  And we were thinking what shall we call the place. And I looked at the can and thought why not Harissa.  In France now people they have it for breakfast.  The North Africans they know it, the Europeans they know itÉand the Americans, they are starting to know it.   Driving, well I used to drive this couple, both actors Ð I learned a lot from them.  Actually I was not so much their driver, more like a friend to them.  And theyÕd invite me into the places they went.  I liked that connection, it reminded me that it doesnÕt matter who you are.  Here is different.  I enjoy it more.  This is like you have a babyÉyou want to see your baby growÉand this is the same for me.    Sometimes I spend 18 hours working.  But still I go home and I sleep and then IÕm up at 7.30.  I used to open at 10.  The kitchen closes at 11 but IÕm here till like 12.30.  ItÕs different, working for people, you want to go home.  But for me this is home. About 4 percent of my customers are North African, the rest are just all the people who you see outside here.    The owner at Il Cantinori he used to go to a table and just talk and talk and I was standing behind him saying I need to take the orderÉand now I see myself doing the same thing.  When people go someplace to eat they want to take a break.  And often they want to talk.  Especially in New YorkÉeverything is individual things, they all do things by themselves.  Now even at the supermarket you donÕt have to talk to somebody you can cash up by yourself.  You almost donÕt talk to nobody.  The good experience from back home that IÕm seeing here at bit now is the flea market.  You talk to people then when youÕre buying something.  ItÕs all about the experience too.  You feel who wants to talk and who doesnÕt.  You have a sense oh this person is tired; this one is working on the computer.  But I can tell when they want to take a break. You ask them if they want to have a glass of water etcÉ  A customer came in yesterday and she said Òin this place you have soul.Ó  30th Ave Ð it went down for a period and then went up again.   IÕve seen 30th Avenue since 1989 Ð when I first came to NYC I was 24, in 1989.  I knew one person who helped me, who lived in Corona.  First time I went out I found a job as a bus boy.  And it was a bit far to travel (I arrived here in October and it was very cold).  So I moved a little bit closer.  Myself and my friend we found a studio, here on 26th Street, then a one bed.  I love it here.  You donÕt feel like an immigrant. Because everybody is. You donÕt have anybody saying anything like Ògo back to your countryÓ.  ItÕs just home.    When I came here 30th Avenue was very good, just like now, well, more with diners etc.  After two years, in 1991, 92, 93 it started going a bit down. The crowd was different.  Then Broadway started coming up, like how it is now.  And then Grand cafŽ took over in their building which used to be a bank.  Now you see a lot of the young, arty Manhattan people coming in.   I have people who come here who say that itÕs like East Village or Williamsburg, because itÕs small and cozy.  In the beginning it happened very quickly.  I used to go 18 miles between the espresso machine and the coffee.  ItÕs more a coffee shop, and the food is extra.  My brother used to do that.  We had a store.  We had two windows and heÕd switch the items from one window to another, to give people the idea of something changing, something new.  It was a family store from my grandfather, to my father, to my brother.  This is how I started, as a kid, you know by the register, picking up the coins and putting them back.  It sells kitchenware.  There was one time when my cousin and I we didnÕt go with the family to our place in the country side for the summer.  We stayed in Algiers.  I had the keys for the store.  So we decided to open the store when we were like 16 and 17, and work like normal.  They had gone for a month.  When they came back the store was almost empty because we didnÕt know how to buy products.  We knew how to sell.  My father came back and he looked at the store and thought Òwhat happened!Ó but he was also kind of happy.   ThatÕs also why I didnÕt have a hard time working with people here in New York City.  I had tougher experience.  People who bargain with you, drive the prices down.  That is how you learn.
