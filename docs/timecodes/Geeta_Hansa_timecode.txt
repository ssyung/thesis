Geeta and Hansa are friends who came across the street from the Hindu Society’s senior center after their meeting to speak with Natalie Milbrodt in the basement of the Ganesh Temple where they could find some quiet. They discuss their involvement with the temple’s activities and some of the community’s customs. Both women say the neighborhood has changed a great deal since they first started coming to the temple. There are fewer Indians and fewer stores where they can get items they want, but both women say they feel very safe in the neighborhood. Geeta asked to not have her photo taken, but Hansa’s portrait was taken on September 12th, 2010 on the day of the Ratha Yatra, which she describes at the end of this interview.  *00:02:30  Diversity of devotees at the temple  00:03:35  Senior center program 00:04:15  Wedding hall, auditorium next door 00:05:03  Geeta’s daughter’s wedding *00:07:20  Changes in neighborhood: fewer Indian stores *00:11:33  Other Hindu temple, no interaction *00:12:30  Speaking / Learning English 00:14:00  Geeta’s daughters’ education *00:14:47  Feeling safe in neighborhood, relationship with neighbors *00:16:00  Seniors group activities **00:18:51  Sri Ganesa Chaturthi: an annual 9 day celebration to honor Ganesh
