Not as much as might have been expected  00:13:30*  Mr. Kramberg really liked that because the Fair wasnÕt an official fair, there were pavilions from smaller countries; Many people who came from the other countries wound up staying in Queens; To him, thatÕs what the WorldÕs Fair was and should be: the diversity of the community; To him, thatÕs also Queens  00:15:30  Mr. Kramberg asks about what other people have talked about in their stories and interviews; AbbyÕs comparison of hearing stories about seeing the Pieta at the WorldÕs Fair versus seeing it herself at the Vatican, where itÕs enclosed in glass and kept under close watch  00:17:04*  Mr. Kramberg compares that experience to taking music out of a film and knowing that itÕs missing something;

Most of these predictions have not come true: still no cure for cancer, no prediction of the fall of Communism  00:21:43  Description of the changing attitudes and expectations: in the 1960s, people were looking forward to space, now looking at climate change and other big issues;
