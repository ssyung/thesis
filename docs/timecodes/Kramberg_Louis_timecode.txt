His math teacher at Jr. High School 204 in Long Island City was a liaison between the school and the World’s Fair; The math teacher had artists’ conceptions of the coming pavilions  00:01:46  Visited the Fair 15 times; Grew up in the Ravenswood housing projects and purchased discount tickets at Gimbal’s next to Macy’s  00:02:26*  Mr. Kramberg was 15 at the time; Description of the influence and impact of the Fair on him in part because of his age; Visited several times with his friend Bruce; For him, it was the feeling and enthusiasm of the Fair rather than anything specific at the Fair; Description of the excitement of going to space and the idea of flying cars  00:04:05  Description of the sense that people have lost that sense of enthusiasm of what could be  00:05:00  Mr. Kramberg thinks that a World’s Fair like the 1964 Fair wouldn’t work as well today because people today look forward to entertainment and technology that arrives quickly, with very little long-term wait (compare to introduction of the picture-phone at the 1964 Fair and its arrival on the regular market 40 years later)  00:06:00*  Description of Mr. Kramberg’s favorite exhibits: DuPont had an interactive exhibit with people and television screens, mention of change of attitudes toward television after Kennedy assassination; Johnson’s Wax Pavilion had film “To Be Alive,” about simple things in life; General Electric’s Carousel of Progress, talking about nuclear fusion, detailed description of Disney’s Carousel of Progress;

Not as much as might have been expected  00:13:30*  Mr. Kramberg really liked that because the Fair wasn’t an official fair, there were pavilions from smaller countries; Many people who came from the other countries wound up staying in Queens; To him, that’s what the World’s Fair was and should be: the diversity of the community; To him, that’s also Queens  00:15:30  Mr. Kramberg asks about what other people have talked about in their stories and interviews; Abby’s comparison of hearing stories about seeing the Pieta at the World’s Fair versus seeing it herself at the Vatican, where it’s enclosed in glass and kept under close watch  00:17:04*  Mr. Kramberg compares that experience to taking music out of a film and knowing that it’s missing something;

Description of some of the supposed new inventions  00:20:17*  Description of the multi-lane highways coming, but cars not driving themselves until now; Most of what was exhibited at 1939 did not become “the world of 1960,” and isn’t the world of 2014 either  00:20:56*  Description of the People’s Almanac, with predictions of the future; Most of these predictions have not come true: still no cure for cancer, no prediction of the fall of Communism  00:21:43  Description of the changing attitudes and expectations: in the 1960s, people were looking forward to space, now looking at climate change and other big issues; These changes are up to the young people; Mention of Vietnam and the anti-war march on Washington, which would not have happened if the draft had not existed; “Be selfish for your generation”  00:22:58  Mr. Kramberg asks if there was a World’s Fair now, what would you want it to be?;
