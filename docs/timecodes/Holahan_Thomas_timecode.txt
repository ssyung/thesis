Thomas Holahan describes his trips to the 1964-1965 WorldÕs Fair, traveling from Yonkers to Queens alone for the first time and comparing the trip to the journey to the park today. He touches on his favorite exhibits and pavilions and describes some of his clearest memories from the Fair, including a funny story about eating Belgian waffles with powdered sugar on a windy day. He also describes his interest in the religious pavilions, which offered profound spiritual experiences in the midst of a secular fair.
