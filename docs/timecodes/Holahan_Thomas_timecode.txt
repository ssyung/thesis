Thomas Holahan describes his trips to the 1964-1965 World’s Fair, traveling from Yonkers to Queens alone for the first time and comparing the trip to the journey to the park today. He touches on his favorite exhibits and pavilions and describes some of his clearest memories from the Fair, including a funny story about eating Belgian waffles with powdered sugar on a windy day. He also describes his interest in the religious pavilions, which offered profound spiritual experiences in the midst of a secular fair. Finally, he talks about how he found the Unisphere to be a powerful symbol of unity.  00:00:00  Introduction  00:00:14*  Description of traveling from Yonkers to Queens on his own for the first time; Description of the ways the fairgrounds have and have not changed  00:01:21  Description of the 7-Up Pavilion’s exotic foods and drinks  00:01:48  Because of the problems in getting countries to come to the Fair, there were more corporations; this had a profound influence on Mr. Holahan; He remembers that the Fair was dominated by the consumer goods  00:02:19  Loved the buildings “that everyone wanted us to love”—the Ford exhibit, the GM exhibit, It’s a Small World  00:02:33*  Description of the Christian Scientist pavilion; the Christian Scientists had one-on-one discussions with people who came to their pavilion  00:03:07  Description of the Belgian waffles; Story about having waffles with powdered sugar on a windy day and sitting upwind of a lady in a black coat, whose coat was soon covered in powdered sugar from his waffle  00:03:36  Description of the Vatican pavilion; The Fair was lucky that Pope John XXIII allowed the Pieta and other pieces to be moved from the Vatican and displayed  00:04:10*  Description of the way that the religious pavilions were able to show such a fantastic spiritual and religious experience in the middle of a very secular fair; Description of having multiple experiences right after another; “you had to take advantage of as much as possible because you could never get this many different experiences in one place ever again”  00:04:39  Description of the entranceway to the Pieta, which displayed Crèches from all over the world; Mr. Holahan also notes that this is a common theme in Christmas art in Rome today  00:05:36  Favorite pavilions: IBM pavilion because of the egg design; Description of IBM’s hydraulic system in the Egg  00:06:42  Found the Unisphere to be very powerful; Mr. Holahan feels the 1939 Fair didn’t seem to have a dynamic theme, but the Unisphere’s idea of everyone coming together was quite powerful
