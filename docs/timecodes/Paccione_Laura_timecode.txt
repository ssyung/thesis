Laura Paccione, a 40-year resident of Bowne Street in the Waldheim section of Flushing, speaks nostalgically of her early experiences there. She particularly enjoys the trees and fondly recalls large family outings to Kissena Park.  However, the huge influx of (mostly) Chinese immigrants into Flushing makes her feel less welcome now because of issues involving language and signage, changed shops, crowds and parking.   00:00:37 Came to Waldheim for decent rent, St. MaryÕs Nativity church & grammar school 00:01:20 Family of six (sheÕs youngest of four siblings; one died). She still lives with her sister    Rose in Waldheim. They have one brother who is still alive; their father died in 1985,    and their mother in 2008.  00:02:56 Traveled to work (bank) for 30 years. Now employed by Queens College, close by. 00:04:30 Kissena Park (20 min. walk). Nature and childhood fun - Sunday family ritual for up to 30 relatives (mother one of seven children), met in park for games, rowing, picnicking, pony rides. No parking problems then. Winter - ice skating.  00:11: 35 Flushing Meadows-Corona Park -- 1964-65 WorldÕs Fair - some childhood memories of exhibits, crowds. Now member of Botanical Gardens, an ÒoasisÓ in the park.  00:17:00 Past - beautiful trees, single homes, many replaced by larger buildings. Family lived in apartment building at first, then in 1970 moved across street. ÒPeople caredÓ then, Òneighbors helped.Ó  Many kids in neighborhood.  00:20:50 Diversity of ethnic groups Òshould be great,Ó but feels people no longer care, she no longer feels welcome.  00:22:25 Boon Temple of Overseas Chinese Mission (OCE) on Bowne Street, corner of 45th.                            Site of former Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) post where father was commander, mother chaplain, so family attended activities there.  00:23:16 Huge Hindu temple (Swaminarayan) in middle of block. Beginning in 1970s, bought many lots, took down houses to build temple. At first fascinating, then temple grew very large. Parking more difficult, especially on Sundays, chaotic. People come from all over as well as this area for temple. They do invite neighbors to come and try to be accommodating but it probably has gotten too large for area. She has visited temple; put off by fact that men and women segregated there.  00:32:05 Safety - never an issue despite Òson of SamÓ in Queens (1976-77). People do walk at night. DidnÕt feel afraid growing up, neighbors looked out for each other. Always felt part of city, not afraid to take train home. First job in Rockefeller Center at 18 - Òa thrill,Ó near NBC Studios, exciting, but prefers living in park-like Flushing. Dad was custodian of PS 111 (LIC). Theft of familyÕs Õ57 Chevy --her only memory of crime.  00:43:16 Shopping Ð During childhood: King Kullen (sister started working there - still with company), WaldbaumÕs on Kissena, other stores, great bakery (LarbyÕs?), banks nearby. Now: Parking difficult, congestion. Fewer American supermarkets and products, mostly Asian bakeries and shops.  00:48:15 Language problems in neighborhood. Too many Asian shops and restaurants lack English signage; used to patronize Asian bakery but no longer feels welcome, no signs in English. This discrimination Òdisturbs me,Ó itÕs not welcoming. DidnÕt used to be the case Ð all ethnicities used to feel welcome; past 5 years or so things have changed. Earlier Indian population spoke English, blended in.  00:55:17 St. MaryÕs Nativity Catholic Church: Church is hurting as congregation diminishes and ages. More families sending children to public school since church school now charging higher tuition. Some racial diversity Ð some Indian and Chinese parishioners. Partnering with St. MichaelÕs in some ways, combining resources. She questions validity of some churches begun in (former) private homes Ð some have run into legal trouble.   01:02:08 Cultural differences can create tension. Some, like public spitting, are ÒdisgustingÓ; she sometimes protests when she sees it happening. More people riding bikes on sidewalks Ð illegal, dangerous to pedestrians. LP pulls flyers off lamp posts (leaves ones for lost dogs). Sometimes local politicians come to Waldheim meetings; these kinds of issues brought up Ð she hopes some improvements may be made. She saw fewer neighborhood tensions with earlier wave of Indian immigrants.   01:15:12 She and sister wanted to leave (traffic, attitudes) to be near brother in ÒpleasantÓ community of Glen Oaks. Loss of job put off plans.      (Disk 2 starts here)  01:20:25 (00:00:57) Would be best for Waldheim to cap further development. ÒToo late for Cherry Avenue.Ó  01:21:36  (00:02:10) Flushing Commons Ð Mixed-use development will add beauty but also congestion. YMCA to be relocated there.  01:23:15 (00:03:45) Flushing movie theaters of past Ð RKO Keith, Prospect; Roosevelt (later became UA Quartet) was farther away. Keith had been beautiful, landmarked theater; illegally destroyed by new owner in 1980s.   01:27:35  (00:08:05) Library Ð She used it more when unemployed; borrowed DVDs. Size, services ÒamazingÓ Ð Chinese cultural center, computer classes, childrenÕs section, language tapes, CDs, etc. for many different cultures.  01:30:35  (00:11:07) Shopping different now. She used to shop a lot on Main Street, now rarely shops locally for clothing, Ònot much left.Ó  01:34:23  (00:14:53) No real Flushing identity in 1960s, 70s. Some accent differences, use of ÒstoopÓ is a Queens/Brooklyn thing.  01:39:28  (00:20:03) Waldheim: Old McDonaldÕs farm was real and located here.  01:40:00  (00:20:32) Shea Stadium Ð Family drove or walked over Flushing Creek to get to MetsÕ games when she was a kid. ÒBleacher creatures.Ó Cost about $1/ticket or free with milk carton coupons. Could take food to game, lots of special promotional days.  01:42:58  (00:23:80) Milk in glass bottles delivered to apartment door in crates. Delivery people took empty bottles back. DidnÕt get newspaper delivered; now mostly reads local papers.  01:46:47  (00:27:12) Mom started working in school lunch program when kids were older to help out family finances.  01:51:07  (00:31:35) Local butcher shop Ð kids sat on bench and got free baloney slices.     Luncheonette with counter next door.   01:53:56  (00:34:31) ÒRemember whenÓ is common but Òmore so around here.Ó  ÒDestination place for a lot of AsiansÓ so FlushingÕs too crammed.  01:54:45  (00:35:16) Family went to Coney Island on Saturdays.
