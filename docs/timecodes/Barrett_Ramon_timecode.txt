This interview discusses LaureltonÕs history as well as Roman BarrettÕs personal history of his community involvement in Laurelton.  Barrett first came to Laurelton, Queens in the 1970s and has witnessed considerable changes occurring in this neighborhood and elsewhere in Queens.  Additionally, Barrett became an active member in several groups that strove to save Queens, mainly through political means, and touches upon his family life.  00:00:54* First lived in Laurelton then moved to Forest Hills and then moved permanently back to Laurelton after seeing homes for sale, what were called ÒCinderellaÓ houses available: itÕs said to be a suitable place for retirement.  00:01:13 Barrett refers to change in Laurelton as a ÒCinderella,Ó Òrags to riches,Ó story in which the homes were decayed after Green Acres shopping mall opened up, causing local businesses to leave for the mall area.   00:01:35 Combination of Brooklyn (Union) Gas and Dime Savings Bank pulled resources together financially, bought and built the houses (ÒCinderellaÓ houses)  00:02:10 Moved in ÒCinderellaÓ home with wife, 1978.  00:02:22* When he came to Laurelton, it was consisted of about 75% Caucasian and 25% other.  Demographic changed because African-Americans & Caribbean people moved in. Barrett believes Caucasians felt their ÒequityÓ (value) was above blacks, so when asked, real estate brokers told them to move.  00:03:10 Italians and Jewish people lived in Laurelton before Barrett moved there.  00:03:17* The Synagogues that were sold when the Jews moved out, are now owned by the Seventh Day Adventists. The Catholic Church stayed.   00:03:45 The Jewish community kept the cemetery over by 120th-130th Ave. on Francis Louis Blvd, where they have their famous rabbi buried.  00:04:38 ÒCinderellaÓ houses are town houses: 13 were built; each contained 2-3 bedrooms with its own spacing.  00:06:27* As a typical resident, Barrett stated, ÒIÕm here to stay.  IÕm not leaving.Ó  00:06:38 Neighborhood has dense population; because of retirees and those who are buying homes at inflated rates but having to get renters because of the great expenses   00:06:51 The reconstruction of homes was to enable renters to live in the homes.  00:07:50* He was part of the block association, block association was held on 230th Place-225th Street.   00:08:03* A year after joining his block association, he became president of the Laurelton Federation, which covers all the blocks in Laurelton.   00:08:14* Term of Office had ended, but he enjoyed it and most of the politicians who were coming to gain exposure because of Barrett who gave them a platform for them to pitch their elections, talks, and much more.  These politicians were able to get most of the things they needed done; Barrett and his colleagues made connections through politicians, even the Police provided them with protection.  00:09:10 During his term as president, there was an attempt to move drugs into the community.  00:09:12* At the time, there was drug war that got a little out of control.  They did a study and there was a shooting on Merrick Blvd. Drug dealer from Sutphin Blvd. area wanted to come into Laurelton to establish a base, unknown to Barrett and his party, and there was a fight going on, a Òcold war,Ó a shooting for territorial rights.  00:09:55* But it became too unbearable so Barrett and colleagues called in all the different segments of government, the police, community board, Borough Commander, and all politicians in the neighborhood.  00:10:13 They all met and drew up plans and developed strategies to get and keep drug dealers out.  00:10:27 Whatever property was owned by those who bought or intended to buy drugs, was confiscated. Politicians angled to get the property from them before they could move in to the neighborhood.   00:10:47* Barrett was the first one to set up a march in Queens.  When he started the march, someone who lived on his block, who knew one of the drug dealers, told her that if she was not living so close to Barrett, they would have burnt his home.  00:11:17 He called the D.A.Õs office after hearing this and met with the Assistant D.A. They investigated and offered valuable protection.  00:11:38 This occurred in the 1980s; Queens D.A. was John Santucci.  00:11:53* Had pictures with Floyd Flake, than Congressman who was over BarrettÕs community and lived in Laurelton for a while; who also is the Pastor of Greater Allen AME Cathedral on Merrick Blvd.   00:12:25* Picture of Donald Manes, who was Borough President at the time who wanted to meet with minority leaders (in which 4 showed up, Barrett included), to discuss what he would love to do for them if they needed help.  00:12:54 Unfortunately, he was not there: shortly after the meeting, he changed his address with no number/phoning address, (suicide).   00:13:23* Barrett worked on Wall Street at Citibank: public transportation was very ideal, easy and cheap.  00:14:26* Residents, try to attend churches, some go out of Laurelton to worship: others stay within the community to worship.  00:14:56 BarrettÕs church in Laurelton: Rose SinclairÕs Room.  00:15:10 The areaÕs religion is a mixture of Roman Catholic, Methodist, Assembly, Pentecostal.   00:15:30 His children were not brought up or born in his current house.  00:15:38* School system was very good and his children were born and raised in Brooklyn, went from elementary to college.   00:16:00 One of his sons got into Brooklyn Tech and from there went to City College, eventually obtaining a MasterÕs Degree in Engineering.  00:16:11 BarrettÕs last daughter was the first to enter Brooklyn Tech when it became co-educational.  She graduated, has a PH.D, and is Assistant D.A. in charge of the Nursing Dept.  00:16:37 His two boys are doing very well, one is an engineer; the other a high-tech individual who Barrett states is very popular and knowledgeable.   00:17:55 A principal in Andrew Jackson High School (now Campus Magnet) a friend to Barrett had taught and still teaches at LaGuardia College.  00:18:22* Laurelton is the best kept neighborhood in the city, Barrett and his neighbors held block beautification; one year they had tulips all over Laurelton, and with another year, impatience and so on.  00:18:45* At Christmas time, they had contest of judging the lawns and lighting of the houses. The award given was a little cup given by the block captain (each block had its own awards ceremony, which varies as to what time they want it done).  00:20:15 No parks around Laurelton, but one was on the South Conduit, closed because of the drug infestation and is now being used for storage. Others use Roy Wilkins Park over on Merrick and Baisley Blvd.   00:21:07 Brookville Park in Rosedale has a tennis court off 47th/147th Ave. on FarmerÕs Blvd.  00:21:33 Barrett did some gardening but it was so tedious and time-consuming, so he passed it on to someone who could do a better job than him; hired a gardener who did everybodyÕs lawn.  (Recently, the gardener came yesterday at the time of this interview.)  00:22:10* When Barrett was gardening, flowers and vegetables were done to a limit; after waiting a while, he  just went to store to buy them and materials to plant.  00:22:34* Always felt that if he couldnÕt get certain work done, Ògive it to the person who is more qualifiedÓ than him and then pay them for that.   00:22:49 In the future, he is confident Laurelton will remain at peace and in place or better because there is more concern by homeowners as to bettering or ensuring that the neighborhood is kept up.  00:23:05 He believes there will be more beautification, more developing, houses will be more maintained.  00:23:22 Sewer lines and water way will be fixed in order to get the water flooding taken care of: a bigger concern happened a couple years ago from Springfield Blvd. to Laurelton, where they had wet rains and basements were over-flooded.
