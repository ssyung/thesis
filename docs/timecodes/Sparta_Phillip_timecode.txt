Philip Sparta (PS): My name is Philip Sparta.  I live on 23rd and Hoyt Ave, so not that far away.  I was born in Japan and moved here ten years ago, when I was six.  Now I’m seventeen.  I got into skateboarding with my best friend over here.    Wallace de Olivera: My name is Wallace.  What I enjoy about skating…it’s the thrill of actually skating.  PS: And it keeps us from doing bad things, you know – we don’t do bad things like most of our friends have gotten into.  It keeps us fit; too, it’s very healthy.  I go to Bryant High School; he goes to La Guardia High School.   Before they thought that the skateboarders were annoying.  Once in a while the police would come and kick us out of this park [Athens Square].  We didn’t really care about it – we loved skating so much that we just kept coming back once they’d left.  And now since the Skate Park opened [in Astoria Park] we hardly come here - once in a while.  But we have other friends here who play basketball.  So we come here once in a while to hang out.   I actually like it around here.  I used to live in Flushing.  Over here is a lot nicer, it’s really diverse.  It’s nice.   I don’t remember too much about living in Japan.  I remember moving here, it was so weird. Now I’m totally Americanized.  I haven’t gone back at all.  I’m not interested in going back really.  Just maybe to skate there.    Daily I skate about four to six hours, sometimes even more, when I’m not in school.  But schooldays I go home around 11 at night.  We skate A LOT actually.  I’ve just gotten back from an injury – I hurt my ankle.  And he did too.  But it’s ok, we got back.
