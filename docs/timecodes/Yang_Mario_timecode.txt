Mario Yang.  I am a Financial Analyst at American Express.  We came here for service at the Taiwanese Union Christian Church.  We mainly come for the community - we have tons of friends who come here, she has a couple of family members, so yeah, itÕs community.    I was born in Taiwan and came here when I was eight.  IÕve been back to Taiwan on occasion.  Generally the community here is very supportive of what we do; we have a wide variety of people at the church.  There are people in arts, people in finance, people in you know all sorts of careers.  TheyÕre very supportive regardless of what you do.    We try to come as much as we can, but sometimes we canÕt make it over.  In Astoria thereÕs a sizable Taiwanese community though itÕs not that concentrated: we congregate here on SundayÕs because of the Church.    My parents brought me over because they wanted a better public education system.  They are firm believers in public education, but didnÕt feel like the system in Taiwan was as good at the time.  ItÕs fantastic now, but back when I was younger they felt it was a better choice to be in the states.  I think I got a great public education here!  I would hope I did.    IÕm actually from North Carolina, I came here for college.
