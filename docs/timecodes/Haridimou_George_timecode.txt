My name is George Haridimou, I am the owner of George’s Auto Repair on 30th Avenue.  I started it 25 years ago.  I bought this place 13 years ago.     The zoning was the only place where I could start an auto repair.  It was more industrial.  Now it’s starting to become more residential here.  And artistic too, there are a lot of artists moving here.  That’s a good thing, the neighborhood is much better than it was even 10 years ago.  I was born in Cyprus, I moved here in 1982.  I grew up in Yonkers but I’ve now lived in Astoria for a long time.  I will probably be here for the rest of my life.  I liked being a mechanic since I was a kid.  It’s mostly European cars we work on.  We work on just about whatever comes in, we try to fix it.  We have this barbeque once in a while.  It’s not specially for [Greek] Independence Day.  Maybe we’ll have one for independence day tomorrow as well!  Well I’m in a fan club for a Greek soccer team [AEK].   We follow it from here.  The neighborhood’s getting better, it’s cleaner.  Before there was a lot of crime.  It wasn’t the nicest part of town.  There used to be a lot of marble places that you don’t see around any more.  And next door there used to be electricians.  Now there’s the 36 family building.  But I’m going to stay here, it’s my own building.  I’m not going away.
