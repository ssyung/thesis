My name is George Haridimou, I am the owner of GeorgeÕs Auto Repair on 30th Avenue.  I started it 25 years ago.  I bought this place 13 years ago.     The zoning was the only place where I could start an auto repair.  It was more industrial.  Now itÕs starting to become more residential here.  And artistic too, there are a lot of artists moving here.  ThatÕs a good thing, the neighborhood is much better than it was even 10 years ago.  I was born in Cyprus, I moved here in 1982.  I grew up in Yonkers but IÕve now lived in Astoria for a long time.  I will probably be here for the rest of my life.  I liked being a mechanic since I was a kid.  ItÕs mostly European cars we work on.  We work on just about whatever comes in, we try to fix it.  We have this barbeque once in a while.  ItÕs not specially for [Greek] Independence Day.  Maybe weÕll have one for independence day tomorrow as well!  Well IÕm in a fan club for a Greek soccer team [AEK].   We follow it from here.  The neighborhoodÕs getting better, itÕs cleaner.  Before there was a lot of crime.  It wasnÕt the nicest part of town.  There used to be a lot of marble places that you donÕt see around any more.  And next door there used to be electricians.  Now thereÕs the 36 family building.  But IÕm going to stay here, itÕs my own building.  IÕm not going away.
