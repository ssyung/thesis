In order to start her business, Ms. Kim has to save a considerable amount of money. She notes that there is lack of affordable daycare places in Long Island. She occasionally finds her asking people for babysitting favors. Currently Ms. Kim does not work because the cost of providing daycare would be more than her salary. She has heard that one can find affordable day care programs in Flushing. She has also heard that one can receive MTA subsidies while one has a child.

She will use English when she is at school, at the doctor’s, or at a government office. Although her child is learning to speak English at school, her child mostly speaks Korean at the house. Ms. Kim is concerned that she will not be able to communicate with her son in the future, and so she is working hard to teach him Korean. Although Ms. Kim is working hard on her English skills she feels that there is a limit to which she can express emotions in her new language.

She is rearing her son to be an American that can understand and empathize with fellow Koreans.  00:28:11 ... .... ...., .. ... ..

Her house on Sanford Avenue was an apartment. After her divorce Ms. Kim found it hard to stay in her apartment on Sanford Avenue without steady income and a shaky legal status. Her Sanford Avenue landlords were Italian and were very hesitant to let Ms. Kim continue renting the apartment. Ms. Kim pled with a realtor because she wanted to raise her child in the apartment which had great natural light. Her realtor reluctantly agreed and assisted Ms. Kim in getting the correct paperwork so she could move in. After this incident Ms. Kim began to think that luck was on her side. 00:37:58 ..... ..... .., .. ... .... .... .... benefit. .. .... ......., Food ..... .. .....  Ms. Kim states that the city government does a great job supporting immigrant mothers with various benefits.

She does not want that to happen. 00:46:22 6.. Flushing... .... .... .. .. . ... .. ..... .. .... . .... .. ...... ... ... .. .. . ..
