People in CORE and the civil rights movement were people committed to non-violence. He also took part in the Young People’s Socialist League.  00:10:31 In the Left Wing Faction of the Socialist Party, 1964.  00:11:13 In 1963, worked on staff for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.  He worked in the office in Harlem, N.Y., from July to August. Describing his experience in Washington – He slept through Martin Luther King’s speech, because he was sleeping under a table - “Don’t expect historical speeches at political rallies.” Bob Dylan sang, etc. “I was more interested in the music than the speeches.” 17 years old.  00:14:15 Worked at mimeograph machine.

At the same time, anti-war movement was growing.  00:22:46 He turned 18 around same time as the Mississippi Project. Knew he was going to be a conscientious objector, but if he refused to register for service, that meant prison. So he registered, as member of an anti-war movement group in February1967.

Clear political motivation.     00:39:06 Applied for conscientious objector status; didn’t get it because he was never even given a hearing for it. The draft board error made it impossible for him to be indicted; the board did not follow its own procedures. Federal court in Brooklyn made a restraining order to Selective Services; couldn’t touch him and other plaintiffs.  00:39:46 So, court couldn’t draft him. Very few people had that status.  00:40:05 Also arrested in December 1966, when the U.S. bombed Hanoi for the first time, at a big demonstration in NYC; he was one of 60+ people arrested, went to trial, and was one of a dozen who went to jail (five days for disorderly conduct).
