We mainly come for the community - we have tons of friends who come here, she has a couple of family members, so yeah, it’s community.    I was born in Taiwan and came here when I was eight.  I’ve been back to Taiwan on occasion.  Generally the community here is very supportive of what we do; we have a wide variety of people at the church.  There are people in arts, people in finance, people in you know all sorts of careers.  They’re very supportive regardless of what you do.    We try to come as much as we can, but sometimes we can’t make it over.  In Astoria there’s a sizable Taiwanese community though it’s not that concentrated: we congregate here on Sunday’s because of the Church.    My parents brought me over because they wanted a better public education system.  They are firm believers in public education, but didn’t feel like the system in Taiwan was as good at the time.  It’s fantastic now, but back when I was younger they felt it was a better choice to be in the states.  I think I got a great public education here!  I would hope I did.    I’m actually from North Carolina, I came here for college.
