Helen Ries was born to parents of Gottscheer ethnicity who emigrated from present day Slovenia.  In this interview, Helen discusses her Gottscheer heritage as well as her life during the Great Depression, World War II and the postwar era.  Following graduation from high school, she worked as a stenographer before marrying her husband in 1946.  Although she grew up in Ridgewood, Helen has also lived in Forest Hills and Glendale, where her children grew up.  She has a son, born in 1949 and a daughter, born in 1952.  Eventually, she moved back to Ridgewood, where she became an active member of the Ridgewood Historical Society.  She has given numerous presentations in the historic Onderdonk House on how life was like in Ridgewood during the early 20th century.    00:00:51: Grew up on Green Avenue and Cypress, near borderline of Brooklyn.  Went to school in P.S. 81 and Grover Cleveland High School.   00:01:47: Parents emigrated from Europe and brought their first house (a six family house) during the Depression time.  People moved in and out/snuck into houses without paying rents.  They could not maintain the house without tenants. They sold the house and bought an eight family house on Woodbine Street, at a net financial loss.   00:03:07: Grew up during the 1930s; children were mostly unaware of the Depression. 00:03:22: Parents were born in modern Slovenia (originally part of Austria-Hungary and then part of Yugoslavia).  Their families were farmers in Europe.  People (of Gottscheer heritage) were displaced after World War 2.  Many from the area of Yugoslavia escaped to Austria and then immigrated to the United States. 00:04:15: Parents spoke Gottscheerish.  Recorded an interview with her mother in which she (Helen) asked questions in English and her mother responded in Gottscheerish. 00:04:50: She would often respond in English to her parents’ Gottscheerish. 00:05:31: Ridgewood was German and Gottscheer.  Neighborhood had a German butcher, etc. 00:06:33: People came to the United States for more opportunities.  Father was one of 12 children in a farming family.  People followed their relatives to the United States. 00:07:17: To immigrate to the United States, you needed a sponsor, a job, and an apartment ready.  Her parents were able to help their relatives emigrate from Europe following World War 2. 00:08:30: Had ration books for food and clothing during war time.  Resources went to the military. 00:10:04: Overall, she really enjoyed her childhood.  Helen notes that life was probably a lot more difficult for adults than for children, who were mostly unaware of Depression era challenges.  She often played games (one game called “Horse Range”) and went to the movies.  Cinema often had live entertainment and film.  She would also go to ice cream parlor after the movies. 00:11:33: There were a lot of theatres in Ridgewood.   00:12:50: Helen lived in the house on Woodbine Street for a few years and then moved away following her marriage.  Parents stayed on Woodbine Street 8 family house for a while before moving to another house (the house where Helen currently lives). 00:13:47: Parents had two daughters.  Most people did not have too many children because they could not afford it. 00:14:39: Started work as a stenographer in a private insurance company.  00:16:04: When kids were in high school, she was offered a tiny little job at an accounting firm.  As she was promoted, this small job became a big job.  When husband became sick, she quit.  Overall though, she really enjoyed her job. 00:17:40: Remembered cobblestone streets and peddlers with horse drawn wagons.  Milk was brought in a box to the stoops of homes. 00:19:25: Homes had an icebox.  Iceman would deliver ice into a dumbwaiter. 00:20:54: Milk and vegetables all came from local farms.  Circus would come to an open field area on DeKalb Ave and Cypress Ave.  They would bring animals (elephants and camels) down Cypress Ave.   00:21:53: Did some work at the Onderdonk House (built in 1709).  Told children visiting the Onderdonk House how neighborhood appeared in the past.  Ridgewood was mostly farmland before it became industrialized.  Before Helen’s time, people could see farms with animals across the street.     00:24:20:  Newtown Creek was an important waterway that allowed Ridgewood farmers in the 1700s-1800s to transport their milk/vegetables to Manhattan.  Pollution from industrial activity and sewage has thoroughly contaminated the creek.  Cleanup efforts are underway. 00:26:12: Manufacturing activity near area of the Onderdonk house:  Welbilt Stoves and Hallmark Cards had factories in the area. 00:27:08 Greater Ridgewood Society started as an imitative to save Onderdonk house from city development.  People collected money to pay back taxes for the Onderdonk house.  Historical Society basically bought the Onderdonk House. 00:27:40: Disastrous fire (1975) burned almost the entire house; only the frame was left intact.  Community had to raise money to rebuild the house.  House was built exactly the way it was before the fire. 00:28:33: Onderdonk families were originally farmers.  In 1900s, farmlands were disappearing from Ridgewood.  Economy of neighborhood around Onderdonk progressively became more manufacturing based. 00:31:40: Remembers assisting a lady during the Depression era.  Garment factories that produced sweaters had finishing portions (leftover fabric material that the machine could not handle).  Helen, along with other children, assisted the lady in collecting these finishing portions.  Lady would then prepare the finishing portions and sell her work back to the factory to make an income. 00:32:41: Father worked in milk factory and then was a trolley operator.   00:34:17: Had some relatives who immigrated to the United States in 1912.  The current house where Helen currently lives was built in 1923, the same year that her parents were married. 00:36:40: Gottscheer Hall hosts several events, including the Miss. Gottschee pageant.  Helen was a Miss. Gottschee briefly at age 19. 00:38:10: Acquainted with 5 people who were killed during World War II. 00:38:30: Husband was also a Gottscheer living in Ridgewood.  They met each other before the war.  Then, her future husband fought in the war.  He was injured on the day the war ended in Europe 00:40:06: On V-J day (end of the war in the Pacific), her future husband made a surprise visit in military uniform to her office.  They were engaged and married on September 21, 1946 at the Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal church. 00:41:47: Son was born on December 31, 1949 and daughter was born 3 years later on Lincoln’s birthday. 00:42:58: Husband got a job at the A and P supermarket (located on Woodbine and St. Nicholas Ave); it is probably a chicken place now.  He also started delis at supermarkets (had 5-6 delis under his administration).  Then, he died of lung cancer in 1969.   00:44:27: There used to be nice stores selling quality merchandise on Myrtle Ave.  However, the neighborhood is changing.   00:46:08: Houses are aging.  Many of them are undergoing much needed maintenance (e.g. redoing the mortar). 00:47:00: Moved to Forest Hills to take care of her elderly mother.  (She and her husband bought a house in Forest Hills from her mother after the last tenant left).  They moved to Glendale after Forest Hills.  Lived in Glendale for 25 years.  She currently enjoys the convenience of Ridgewood; subway and bus lines are very accessible. 00:48:41: Children grew up in Glendale.  Son lives in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  Daughter lives in the area but travels for business frequently. 00:49:43: Many of her friends and cousins have died.  She is currently 88 years old.  She still has a good friend, Ruth, who is also the same age.   00:52:00: Went to a roller skating rink that used to be in Queens Center Mall.  As a teenager, Helen also frequently visited Coney Island and Manhattan. 00:54:00: During wartime, trolley tracks were torn to provide steel for the war effort. 00:56:33: Trolleys were easily stranded because of weather conditions such as heavy snow.  A snowbound trolley would have to wait for a second trolley to arrive and brush off the snow. 01:00:00: Helen’s mother used to buy live chickens at the chicken market.  The chicken market disappeared by the time Helen got married.  There are chickens housed at the Onderdonk house now.  She feels that it is important for children today to visit the Onderdonk House, see the chickens and have an overall awareness of Ridgewood’s farming heritage.  Many children no longer receive any type of exposure to agriculture. 01:02:43: People did their own baking.  There was no freezer or refrigerator.  There was only an icebox.  During the winter, there were no ice deliveries and the box had to be kept outside.   01:04:02: Icebox had to be periodically cleaned (Whenever the ice melted, the water had to be emptied). 01:05:25: Streets used to have gas lights. There used to a lot of gas lines that ran through houses.  Gas was used to fuel chandelier lights in houses.
