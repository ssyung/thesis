Lived in Midtown Manhattan, got married to a man from Bronx who didn’t want to live in Manhattan and they couldn’t find an apartment there, so they moved to 49th Street between Skillman and Barnett avenues. At the end of the street is the private Sunnyside Garden Park. After 16 years in their first home, moved to 41st Street across from PS150; Betty has been at the second location for 33 years. [~00:01:39] 00:01:40* Changes in the neighborhood.

It’s good to preserve the atmosphere of Sunnyside. Sunnyside was like a little town, especially on Skillman Ave., and remains that way today.
