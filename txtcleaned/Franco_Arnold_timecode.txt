Arnold Franco grew up in Richmond Hill, New York and currently resides in Manhattan. In this interview Arnold discusses his childhood in Queens, his experiences in Queens College, his time serving during World War II and life after the war. Being a Veteran and an Alumnus, Arnold decided to give back to Queens College and those who served in the war with generous donations that helped build a memorial on the campus. Queens College even has a The Arnold Franco Prize for Writing in History. He wrote a book with the help of Paula Spellman called “Code to Victory”, that tells of Franco's experiences as a World War II cryptanalyst and of his unit where he learned how to intercept and break "in-the-moment" coded messages sent by German pilots. Annually, the History Department at Queens College awards a prize in his name to the best example of historical writing by a student for a given academic year. 00:00:27 Arnold Franco grew up in southern end of Richmond Hill. 00:03:13 in 1933, at the age of 10, Franco grew up when America was in the midst of the depression.
